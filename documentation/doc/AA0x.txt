******************** ACCRETION-ABLATION PARAMETERS *************************  

Addition or removal of volatiles or particulate materials contributing to landform
evolution is controlled by parameters in this module.  The switch for using  
Accretion/ablation modeling (MI8x) in the MARSSIM_INITIAL_BOUNDARY_CONDITIONS.PRM 
parameter file should be set to unity to enable any of the processes used in this
module.  There are three process suites in this module:
(1) ACCRETION and ABLATION involves addition or removal of surface materials 
at a constant rate determined by the accretion_rate parameter. See popup AA1x
for details.
(2) Exposure-dependent mass wasting.  This is enabled by the EXPOSURE_DEPENDENT_CREEP
switch.  See popup AA2x for details.
(3) Ablation or condensation of volatiles to planetary surfaces by solar radiation-driven
processes.  See popup AA3x for details.

Under normal circumstances only one of these three process suites (if any) should be used
in one simulation. to disable accretion and ablation set the ACCRETION_RATE to 0.0. The others
are enabled or disabled by setting the AA2x and AA3x switches.
