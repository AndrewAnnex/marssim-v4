 ACCRETION OR ABLATION RATE 

If the switch for modeling accretion and ablation is set in
MARSSIM_INITIAL_BOUNDARY_CONDTIONS.PRM then this value sets the
process rate, which may be positive for accretion or negative for ablation. 
The accretion or ablation can be slope-normal if DEFAULT_EOLIAN_PROCESS
(set in the EOLIAN_PARAMETERS.PRM parameter file) or be vertical 
accretion or erosion. It slope-normal the vertical rate of
elevation change is equal to accretion_rate/Cos(slope_angle).
The accretion rate is in meters per year.
The local slope gradient used to define accretion rate uses
a planar fit to the location and the 8 surrounding points.

Set this parameter to 0.0 to disable accretion and ablation using
this process suite.
