 [I] USE EXPOSURE-DEPENDENT_CREEP                                                            

If this parameter is set to 1.0,  gradient-dependent creep mass wasting occurs 
with diffusivity being governed in proportion to the'exposure'.
There is the option to use either of two different measures of 'exposure' 
(exposure and topexpose) and to have positive exposure enhance or diminish creep rate
dependent on the setting of USE INVERSE EXPOSURE (popup AA5x).
The local exposure index can be smoothed prior to creep rate determination if
smooth-exposure-value is set to 1 (see popup AA6x).
The eolian rate function parameters in the EOLIAN_PARAMETERS.PRM FILE (popups EO7x to EO10x)
define the dependence of creep rate on exposure.
