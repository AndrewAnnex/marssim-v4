 [I] USE SOLAR INSOLATION ABLATION OR DEPOSITION

If this is set to 1 and the switch for ablation-accretion modeling
is set in MARSSIM_INITIAL_BOUNDARY_CONDITIONS.PRM then solar-driven volatile 
sublimation and condensation are modeled. Several rate variables and switches
control the volatile processes. RADIATION RATE CONSTANT (AA7x popup) is the basic rate controling
variable for erosion by solar radiation. RADIATION_DEPOSITION_RATE (AA10x popup)is the rate 
controlling factor for ice deposition.  Both ablation and condensation are dependent
not only by direct thermal radiation but also by reflected or re-emitted thermal radiation
from surrounding slopes visible from the local site.  The distance outward that radiation
influx from surrounding slopes is considered is set by MAX_OUT_DISTANCE (EO13x popup)and
WEIGHTING_CALCULATION_DISTANCE (EO12x popup) in the EOLIAN_PARAMETERS.PRM file. The
amount of incoming radiation from surrounding cells is set by the relative orientations of
the local and distant site and by inverse-square of the intervening distance. 
The amount of surface erosion during ablation is also affected by the VOLUME_CHANGE_COEFFICIENT
in the WEATHERING_PARAMETERS.PRM file (popup WE4x) such that particulate material may be
mixed with volatile ices. The parameter DEPOSITION FRACTION (popup AA11x) influences the rate
of ice deposition in the case where the volatile deposition is derived from ablated volatiles
elsewhere.  A DEPOSITION FRACTION <1.0 implies either that some fraction of the ablated volatile
is lost from the system or that the ablated volatiles only contain a fraction of the ablated
material.

Landform evolution resulting from radiation-dependent volatile sublimation or condensation has
been used in four MARSSIM-based studies. (1) In Howard and Moore (2008) volatile-rich "bedrock" is
weathered by solar radiation, with released particulates creeping my mass wasting, and water ice is
recondensed on convex-upward slopes due to low reflected radiation.  In thaat study the presence of ice,
dust, or bedrock surface was determined by the three state variables: An ice-covered surface is
indicated by IS_SEDIMENT_COVERED being True and IS_ROCK_SURFACE is False. A bedrock surface is indicated
by IS_ROCK_SURFACE being True and IS_SEDIMENT_COVERED being False. A dust (sediment-covered) surface is
indicated by IS_ROCK_SURFACE being False and IS_SEDIMENT_COVERED being False.
(2) In Howard, Moore et al.(2012) sublimation without recondensation is used to model Hyperion's
landscape.
(3) In Moore et al. (2017) Development of a pitted landscape on Pluto is modeled by solar-driven
sublimation of nitrogen ice.
