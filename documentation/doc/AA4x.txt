 [I] USE TOP EXPOSURE  

This determines whether the local "exposure" for exporure-related creep is 
calculated using the FIND_TOP_EXPOSURE_INDEX function or the EXPOSURE function.  
Both calculate a local exposure index by iterating from the given location 
out to surrounding points and calculating the exposure through weighted
summing:
EL - local elevation
ED - distant locality elevation
EX - the exposure term
DX - distance between EL and ED
WT - distance weighting
DF - distance weighting factor
EV - calculated exposure value
EX = (EL-ED)/DX
WT = exp(-DF*DX)
EV = sum(EX*WR)/sum(WT) where the summation occurs over all cells in the
     search radius 
	 
The difference between FIND_TOP_EXPOSURE_INDEX and EXPOSURE is that the
former cycles over all cells within the search radius and includes both
positive and negative gradients, whereas the latter extends out in only
8 directions and counts exposure only for cell pairs which are visible from
the given location.
