 RADIATION RATE CONSTANT (meters per year)

 This is the scale constant that determines the rate of solar
 radiation ablation as scaled by the local value of the
 function RAD_ERODE that sums over cells in the search
 radius and determines the re-radiation loading from the
 distant cells as affected by visibility, relative slope
 orientations and weighted by inverse square of separation.
