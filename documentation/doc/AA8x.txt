 RADIATION SOURCE FACTOR    

This factor differentiates in terms of radiation input from
surrounding cells depending upon whether the cell is bedrock
or regolith, for which the equivalent bedrock radiation input
is multiplied by the RADIATION SOURCE FACTOR.  The reasoning is that
the dusty regolith generated by ablation of bedrock has a lower thermal
inertia than the bedrock and is likely darker in coloration, both
of which increase potential daytime thermal reradiation and likewise
increase the contribution to local ablation.
