 THRESHOLD DEPOSITION CONVEXITY  

This is used for modeling of ice condensation.
On Callisto water ice accumulates on convex upward
slopes, such as ridge edges and crater rims.  This 
parameter specifies how convex a slope must be (negative value) to
be subject to ice condensation.  The convexity is
calculated by the FIND_TOP_EXPOSURE_INDEX function.
The ice is assumed to be derived from exposed volatile-
rich bedrock on steeper crater slopes.
