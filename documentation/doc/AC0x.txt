************************  ALLUVIAL CHANNEL PARAMETERS **************** 

Alluvial channels, alluvial fans, and deltas are modeled by a simpliifed algorithm
that routes sediment flux from slopes and upstream bedrock channels downstream assuming
that the alluvial channel gradient equals the equilibrium gradient necessary to transport the
bed sediment(total load - bed and suspended sediment).  The sediment is routed and deposited 
at this gradient until the supplied sediment has been exhausted. This procedure is detailed in
Howard (1994).  The equilibrium gradient is calculated using a Meyer-Peter like transport
equation.  The formulation assumes a single representative grain sixe - sand or gravel.
The Grevel Mixture module with limited capabilities can route multiple gravel grain sizes over 
small simulation domains.
