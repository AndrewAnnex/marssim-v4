 GLOBAL OCEAN_ELEVATION 

If a fixed oceanic or estuarine shoreline is to
be modeled then this is the "ocean" level.  If
this is not to be used, set the value to being well
below the lowest elevation in the domain.  Note
that a fluctuating ocean/estuarine baselevel can
be modeled if this is specified in MARSSIM_INITIAL_
BPIMDARY_CONDITIONS.PRM.
