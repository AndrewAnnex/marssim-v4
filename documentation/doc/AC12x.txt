 DELTA_FORESET_GRADIENT  

This ls the gradient for foreset beds deposited during
delta progradation.  For bedload-dominant channels this might
be close to the angle of repose of loose sedimet.  For channels
carrying a high suspended or wash load, this might be just a few
degrees, as with the Mississippi River delta.
