 EFFECTIVE_DISCHARGE_RATIO

This is the effective discharge for sediment transport relative
to the routed discharge through the fluvial network.  The routed
discharge is assumed to be the geomorphically effective discharge
for bedrock channel erosion as represented by the parameters in
the FLOW_PARAMETERS.PRM file.  That diwcharge is likely to be higher
than the geomorphically effective discharge for sediment transport,
so that this parameter might be set to less than unity.
