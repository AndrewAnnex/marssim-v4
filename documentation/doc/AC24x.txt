 [I] STICKY_SEDIMENT_ROUTING (0 normal, 1 "sticky")  

Thiw switch was included to provide a inheritance to sediment routing
so that diversions on alluvial surfaces require a gradient for flow diversion into a new
channel somewhat greater than the present downstream gradient on a 
probabilistic basis.

This was never implemented and so has no effect.
