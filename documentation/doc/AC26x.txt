 BEDLOAD_FRACTION  

The is the fraction of the sediment delivered to the
channel surface that is considered to be in the size
range of bed material.  This is used to determine the
 gradient of alluvial depositional surfaces.  On alluvial
 surfaces not terminating in ponded water or an ocean the
 total sediment load (including wash load) is used to determine
 the volume of deposited sediment.  When sediment is transported
 into ponded water (lakes or ocean) the bedload_fraction portion
 of the total load is deposited on fans, topset, and foreset beds,
 and the remaining fraction is deposted as bottomset deposits
 in the lake/ocean floor.
