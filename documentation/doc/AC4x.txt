 [I] DO SEDIMENT_DIFFUSION (0=NO. 1!YES) 

If this is selected then sediment routing will occur
by straightforward finite differencing.  Because sediment
transport uses large exponents for both channel gradient and
sediment transport flux, VERY small timesteps must be used or
the simulation will become unstable.  Use of sediment diffusion
therefore is discouraged.  A more stabe diffusion scheme could be
implemented (e.g. predicor-corrector) that might improve diffusion
routing.
