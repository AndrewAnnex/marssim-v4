 [I] NO_FLUX_LOWER_BOUNDARY (0=NO. 1!YES)   

This is a specialized circumstance and should be used
ONLY when the boundary condition of a horizontal lower
boundary is selected in MARSSIM_INITIAL_BOUNDARY_CONDITIONS.PRM
Selecting this essentially assumes the lower boundary is a tall-
reflective wall that sediment is deposited against.
