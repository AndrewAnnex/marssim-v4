 [I] DO_ALLUVIAL_SMOOTHING (0=NO. 1!YES)  

The routing model assumes sediment is transported in
a single path following the steepest descent.  Thus,
on alluvial fans, only a single channel is active at any
time. As sediment is deposited and the fan aggrades, 
however, the channel will shift to new courses across
the fan.  Selecting this switch applies applies diffusive
smoothing to the fan surface after each iteration to make
the single channels less obvious.  This is not generally
used, but can be experimented with.
