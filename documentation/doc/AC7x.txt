 [I] DO_ALLUVIAL_REROUTING (0=NO. 1!YES) 

Any particular alluvial fan may have sediment contributions
from multiple sources (debouching channels and slopes). Setting
this switch to 1 recalculates gradient directions after routing
sediment from a single source, permitting avulsions within a given
iteration.  This rerouting is time-consuming and is not fully 
tested, so use of this switch is not recommended.
