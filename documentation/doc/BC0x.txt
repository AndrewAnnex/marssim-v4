************************  BEDROCK CHANNEL PARAMETERS  **************** 

This set of parameters pertains to erosion of channels with exposed or partially
exposed bedrock.  The default treatment of bed erosion as being proportional to
stream power, defined broadly, is discussed in Howard (1994, 1997, & 2007).  More
recently, the option has been added to relate bed erosion to abrasion rate by 
bedload in transport.  Additional options include: 1) the possibility to have a threshold
behavior for erosion of vegetated surfaces on low-order slopes and channels, as
discussed in Howard and Tierney (2012); 2) An alternative way to treat the effects of
vegetation is through bistable states, applied to modeling gully development by Howard (1999);
3) Having bedrock erodibility be spatially and depth-dependent by having a 3-D matrix of
erodibility; and 4) Allowing for the possibility of a surface crust of more indurated material, 
such as a caliche layer or other duricrust.
