 BEDROCK_ERODIBILITY FOR STREAM POWER 

This is the intrinsic bedrock erodibility for
the stream power incision model. it can vary
widely depending upon bedrock properties, The
constant relates yearly bed erosion rate to the
channel discharge and channel gradient, and
thus depends upon the value of the discharge
exponent. For a discharge exponent of 0.3 erodibility
can vary from 1.0E-2 (for shaly or fine-grained
saprolite to 1.0E-10 for very hard bedrock.
