  DETACHMENT_CRITICAL_SHEAR

This is the critical shear value that sets a lower limit
to fluvial detachment using the stream power model. A very
narrow range of this parameter separatez widespread fluvial 
erosion to no fluvial erosion. The MARSSIM_INITIAL_BOUNDARY_CONDITIONS.PRM
file allows parameters to be entered that cause iteration-to-iterateion
variation of critical shear (or critical stream power) using a 
log-normal distribution.
