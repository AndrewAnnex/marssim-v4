 REGOLITH_ERODIBILITY_FACTOR  

MARSSIM envisions that regolith is more erodible
than bedrock, coupled with the concept that regolith
from weathering or introduced by mass wasting is eroded
during each time step, and if all regolith can be
eroded, then the remainder of the timestep erodes
the underlying bedrock.  This parameter is generally
>=1.0 and serves as a divisor to the erosion resistance
of regolith relative to bedrock.  If it is set to unity 
there is no distiction in erodibility between regolith and bedrock.
