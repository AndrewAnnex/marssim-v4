 REGOLITH_CRITICAL_SHEAR_FACTOR                                                 

MARSSIM envisions that regolith has a lower critical shear
stress than bedrock, coupled with the concept that regolith
from weathering or introduced by mass wasting is eroded
during each time step, and if all regolith can be
eroded, then the remainder of the timestep erodes
the underlying bedrock.  This parameter is generally
>=1.0.  This value of critical shear stress is entered as a divisor
to that of bedrock, such that if there is no bedrock critical shear
stress this value has no effect. The value of this parameter is 
usually set to a value equal to the regolith erodibility factor.
