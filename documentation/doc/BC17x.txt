 CHANNEL_WIDTH_CONSTANT    

Channel width is parameterized as a simple power function of
discharge:

WC is the channel width constant
WE is the channel width exponent
W is channel width
Q is the geomorphically effective discharge

W = WC * Q**WE  (** is exponentiation)

Channel width is used to determine bed shear, stream power per unit
width, and sediment transport flux per unit width.
