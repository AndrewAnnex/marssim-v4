 [I] VARIABLE_VEGETATION_RESITANCE - INDEX FOR MODELING VEGETATION EROSION
SHEAR  RESISTANCE (1-YES, 0=NO)

This switch determines whether vegetation will be considered as factor determining
resistance to fluvial erosion.  The argument is that on slopes and upland hollows
vegetation acts as a significant impediment to fluvial erosion, but vegetation
becomes less of a factor downstream.  This was used by Howard and Tierney (2012)
to model landform evolution in Virginia.  The next four parameters parameterize this
effect.

TU = vegetation upland resistance shear factor (Pascals)
TC = downstream channel resistance shear factor
AMN = contributing area below which the shear resistance is given by TU
AMX = contributing area above which the shear resistance is given by TC
AR = local contributing drainage area
LC = local shear resistance

For AR<AMN: LC = TU
for AR>AMX: LC = TC
For contributing areas between AMN and AMX:
VFS = (log(TU)-LOG(TC))/(log(AMN-log(AMX))
VFI = log(TU)-VFS*log(AMN)
LC=exp(log(AR)*VFS+VFI)
