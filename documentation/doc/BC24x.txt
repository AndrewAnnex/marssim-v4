************************ BISTABLE EROSION **************************** 

This is a different method than used by the previous 5 parameters to have 
a vegetation control on channel erosion.  Howard(1999) used the method
controlled by the following parameters to model gully initiation, growth, and
cessation.  The idea is that either a rapid local erosion rate or a decrease
in vegetaion resistance (e.g., fire or overgrazing) can trigger transition to
an accelerated state of erosion, but a return to normal erosion rates can
occur only when the local erosion rate drops to a low value
The next 8 parameters control this behavior:
BI = selection parameter for the possibility of bistable fluvial erosion (see popup BC25x)
BB = switch for using bistable bedrock resistance (see popup BC26x)
LT = lower erosion rate transition threshold (see popup BC27x)
HT = high erosion rate transition threshold (see popup BC28x)
EL = erosion rate change lag (see popup BC29x)
BC = Bistable critical shear (see popup BC30x)
BR = bistable runoff factor (see popup BC31x)
BE = bistable bedrock erodibility (see popup BC32x)
NC = the normal state critical shear for bedrock erosion (see popup BC14x)
NB = the normal state bedrock erodibility (see popup BC10x)
NF = normal factor for converting NC and NB to regolith values of NC and NB (see p0pups BC15x and BC16x) 
AC = if AC==True erosion is in an accelerated state, if AC==False it is in a normal state
ER = local erosion rate during last iteration
LC = local bedrock critical shear
LE = local bedrock erodibility

If BI == 0 then there is no bistable behavior, otherwise:
AC==>False if ER<LT or the channel is alluvial 
AC==>True if ER>HT
EL introduces a lag in transition in response to changes in ER 
IF AC==False erosion rate is controlled by NC and NB, i.e. LC=NC and LE=NE   
If AC==True then:
  local runoff is increased by the factor BR
  LC=BC*NC
  LE=BE
  LC for regolith=BC/NF
  LE for regolith=BE
