 EROSION_RATE_CHANGE_LAG 

This governs how rapidly the nominal local erosion rate
changes. Let 1>=CL>0 be the change lag. If PE is the previous iteration 
erosion rate and NE is the present iteration erosion rate, then the lagged
erosion rate, LE, is LE=(i-CL)*PE + CL*NE.  See BC25x popup for
further explanation
