 [I] USE EXPLICIT BED STATE (0= IMPLICIT, 1= EXPLICIT) 

Erosion by flowing water was conceptualized by Howard (1994) to
include a channel within each simulation cell whose width is
parameterized.  During erosion both regolith derived by weathering
and mass wasting must be eroded as well as bedrock, leading to
three possible states: A totally bedrock channel with no regolith,
a channel which is partially, or episodically covered by thin
regolith that is eroded during each simulation time step, or a 
channel flowing on thick regolith or other uncosolidated material.
Howard (1994) conceived the treatment such that during each timestep
the channel first erodes regolith, and then, if it all regolith
has been eroded, the bedrock channel bed is scoured.  This implicit
channel bed state was outlined in Howard(1994) and the same concept
with a somewhat more explicit treatment of bed state was added later
Howard(2007). The more explicit state is now preferred, so that having this
parameter set to 1 is preferred.
