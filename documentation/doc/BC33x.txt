********3-D SPATIALLY VARYING BEDROCK RESISTANCE **** 

Two types of 3-D spatial and temporal variation in bedrock
erosional resistance can be modeled.  In the first type, controlled
by the next four parameters, a 3-D matrix is read in to set the
local bedrock erodibiliy as well as regolith diffusivity.

THe last three parameters control a different type of bedrock erodibility,
in wich a surface crust, such as a duricrust layer, is imposed whch has a
lower erodibility until that crust is eroded through.  The use of a surface
crust might also represent erosion through a vegetation layer, although the
bistable erosion method provides more flexibility.

DO NOT USE BEDROCK ERODIBILITY BEING CONTROLLED BOTH BY A 3-D MATRIX AND BY
A SURFACE CRUST.
