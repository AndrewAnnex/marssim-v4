 [I] USE 3D SPATIALLY VARYING BEDROCK RESISTANCE TO WEATHERING AND EROSION (0=NO,1=YES)

 If this is selected, then an unformatted direct access file RESIST.IN must be present
 in the working directory. For this file i is the lateral direction, left to right, j is
the downward direction, j downward, and k is the vertical direction, increasing downward.
Tte function READ_ERODIBILITY accesses erodibility values from the file.  Given I,J,K indices
the record number is J+MY*I-1)+MX*MY*(K-1). If the index for resistance variability (next parameter)
is 1 then the value of resistance that is input, RR, is transformed by lognormal random variability
with RR as the mean value and resistance variability (BC36x) as the log standard deviation.

See BC33x for discussion of 3-D bedrock resistance to weathering and erosion.
