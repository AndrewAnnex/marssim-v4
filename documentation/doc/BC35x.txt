 [I] SCALE_3D_ROCK_ERODIBILITY -INDEX FOR RESISTANCE VARIABLILITY (0=ABSOLUTE,
1=LOGNORMAL RANDOM SCALING)

 This controls the use of the rock resistance read from the direct access RESIST.IN
 file. If this index is zero, the resistance is the value read from the file. If it
 is 1 then the resistance is subject to lognormal noise scaled by RESISTANCE_VARIABILITY.
 
 See popup BC34x for more details.
