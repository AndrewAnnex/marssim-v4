 VERTICAL_RESISTANCE_SCALING  

Because the depth of erosion in modeled landscapes is often
considerably less than the lateral dimensions, this parameter
allows the vertical scaling of resistance values in the RESIST.IN
file to have higher resolution than the horizontal dimensions.
For example, if VERTICAL_RESISTANCE_SCALING is 0.5 then the vertical
dimension of a 3-D cell is half that of the horizontal dimensions.
