 [I] RESISTANT_SURFACE lAYER - CRUSTUSE (0=NO CRUST, 1= CONSTANT ThICKNESS SURFACE CRUST
 2=SURFACE CRUST THICKNESS IS READ IN.

If this switch is set to unity, then a resistant surface crust will be imposed
at the start of the simulation.  This could correspond to, e.g., a duricrust.
The thickness and erosional resistance of the crust are set by parameters BC39x and
BC40x.  When erosion has cut through the crust, the erosional resistance
values revert to the nominal resistance. If the CRUSTUSE index is set to 2, then
a file SURFACE_CRUST.DAT must be present in the execution directory.  This file
must have the same dimensions as the main simulation dimensions, and each value in
the file is the crust thickness, in meters.

See BC33x for general discussion of 3_D varying resistance to erosion and weathering.
