 SURFACE_LAYER_RESISTANCE FACTOR  

This value is the factor by which the default rock resistance
is multiplicativly changed relative to the default rock resistance.
In addition, the rate of rock weathering is changed by the same
multiplicative factor.  In general the resistance factor is greater
than 1.0, but if less than 1.0 it could model a more erodible surface
layer.
