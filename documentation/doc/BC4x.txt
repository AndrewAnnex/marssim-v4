 SKLAR ROCK_TENSILE_STRENGTH (megapascals, range~1-25)

If the Sklar and Dietrich (2004, WRR) bed abrasion model is 
selected, the bed erodibility is parameterized by rock
tensile strength, which can vary in the range from 1 to ~25
megapascals.

An important issue with sediment-load-dependent erosion is
treating how sediment is introduced into the channel system.
In almost all natural landscapes the great majority of the
sediment load is derived from mass wasting from surrounding
slopes.  In the Sklar-Dietrich model this introduces a strong
positive feedback between channel erosion and supply of 
sediment locally and as routed from upstream.  It also
introduces the issue of how sediment is introduced in headwater
regions of low gradient.  As implemented here, low relief areas
remain largely uneroded until incision waves penetrate upstream
and slopes begin to contribute sediment.
This largely distinguishes the erosional pattern from sediment-load-dependent
models from the stream power model.
