 [I] USE SHEAR RATIO IN DENOMINATOR OF FLUX!DEPENDENT EROSION (1=YES,
0 = NO)

In the default Sklar-Dietrich model there is a term that accounts for
saltation hop length that acts to inhibit the rate of incision on steeper
becrock channel slopes. This term is disregarded in the Chatanantavet and
Parker (2009, JGR) bed abrasion model, so the option is given to not
include that term by setting this switch to 0.  

 See popup BC3x for more details.
