 [I] SKLAR_SATURATION_USE -USE SKLAR PARABOLIC SATURATION FORMULA (0)
OR USE TUROWSKI EXPONENTIAL SATURATION RATIO (1)

The Sklar and Dietrich bed abrasion model has a parabolic bed cover effect
such that abrasion rates approach zero abruptly as the sediment load reaches
saturation.  Turowski et al. (2007, JGR) propose a more gradual approach to
reduced bed scour rate based on a negative exponential function.  That approach
can be selected by setting this switch to 1.
