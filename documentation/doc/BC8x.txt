  BEDROCK_DISCHARGE_EXPONENT  

This is the exponent governing the dependency of
bed erosion rate on discharge in the stream power
model.  Typical values include 0.3 for shear stress
dependency and 0.5 for stream power per unit width.
Higher values have been suggested based upon studies of
long-term erosion rates.
