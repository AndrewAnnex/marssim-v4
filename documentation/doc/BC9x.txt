   BEDROCK_GRADIENT_EXPONENT                                                    

This is the exponent governing the dependency of
bed erosion rate on channel gradient in the stream power
model.  Typical values include 0.7 for shear stress
dependency and 1.0 for stream power per unit channel width.
Higher values have been suggested based upon studies of
long-term erosion rates.
