******************** CRATERING PARAMETERS ***************************** 

This module implements impact cratering within MARSSIM simulations.  Craters
are created geometrically, not dynamically.  The shape of a crater, including
the crater interior bowl, the rim, and ejecta is determined through shape
parameters. Details about the parameterization are given in Forsberg-Taylor et al (2004)
and Howard(2007.  Craters can be created in two basic ways:
1) As random events, such that the location and crater size are drawn randomly, using about
   production curve for the crater diameters.  THe parameter IMPACT_PROBABILITY determines the
   likelihood of an impact during each iteration
2) As specified events, such that the crater size, location, and time of impact are read from
   input files.  This is useful if the temporal evolution of a specific region is being simulated.
   An example of this is presented in Matsubara et al. (2018).
These two modes can be used together, such as specifying large crater events coupled with a random background
of small random crater events.

Another dichotomy in the simulation oaraneters determines whether craters are modeled using geometric
shape parameters or whether crater morphology is based upon selected actual fresh crater topography.  This
is implemented for martian craters.  Because of the limitations on the number of fresh craters imposed on
relatively planar terrain, this database has only been compiled for craters between 15-100 km diameter.  If
used, craters with diameters <15 km are geometrically modeled. as are craters>100 km.
