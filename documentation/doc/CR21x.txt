 CRATER_FREQUENCY_EXPONENT  

When craters are selected randomly the cumulative size
distribution of simulated craters is assumed to follow
an inverse power law distribution:
 
ND - cumulative mumber of craters per unit area per unit time
      larger than crater diameter DI
DI -  simulated crater diameter (in neters)
CE -  crater_frequency_exponent  
FR -  Frequency_cutoff_scaling (popup CR22x)
ND assumed to be proportional to DI**(-CE)
AL = 1.0/CE
LMC - largest_modeled_crater  (generally less than half the
      simulation domain width or depth) (popup CR25x)
SMC - smallest modeled crater  (generally equivalent to 3 to
      5 simulation cell widths) (popup CR23x)
CC = 1.0/(1.0/(LMC**CE) -1.0/(SMC**CE))
BC = -CC/(SMC**CE)

DO this:
   RR - a uniform random number in the 0-1 size range
   DI = (CC/(RR-BC))**AL
until DI>exp(FR*(SMC-DI)) 
DI is the modeled crater diameter
