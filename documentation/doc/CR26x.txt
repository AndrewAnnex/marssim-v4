 EJECTA_THICKNESS_VARIABILITY
 
This is the standard deviation of variation of the 
thickness of the ejecta from the crater - scaled to
the ejecta thickness.  This is partially cosmetic, to
create a more realistic looking crater, but also
serves the funcion of roughening the surface for more
realism in fluvial incision and mass wasting.
This random variability is also applied to the crater
interior, with variability increasing from none at the
crater center to the value of this parameter at the 
crater rim.
