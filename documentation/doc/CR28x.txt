 INHERITANCE_PARAMETER   

When an impact hits a planetary surface the resultant crater
morphology is affected by the underlying topography. This is
reflected in the inheritance_parameter.  Generally near the
center of a larger crater the crater floor topography is totally
reworked, giving a nearly flat floor no matter what the original
surface looked like (no ineritance).  In the far field, at the edges
of the ejecta sheet, the ejecta is superimposed on the pre-existing
topography (total inheritance).  The degree of inheritance is reflected
in MARSSIM by this parameter, which governs how the degree of inheritance
changes from the center of the crater to the outer edge of the ejecta.
The inheritance parameter is assumed to be in the range of 0.5 to 1.0.
If it is 1.0 then the modeled crater excavation and ejecta depostion
is directly controlled by the existing underlying topography, producing
a nearly fractal roughness.  An ineritance parameter near 0.9 appears
to give the most realistic cratered landscape.  Details are presented
in Howard(2007) but summarized below:

RR - distance from the crater center
DI - diameter of the simulated crater
ER = a "reference elevation" calculated by pre-impact elevations inside the
crater ant elevations outside the crater rim weighted by (2*RR/DI)**-N, 
where N is the exterior shape exponent (see popup CR8x)
IP - the inheritance parameter
EM - the elevation change modeled by the crater scaling (see popup CR8X)
EL - the local pre-impact topography
EC - the resultant net elevation change
IX - the INHERIT_EXPONENT (>=2) (popup CR31x)
For the crater interior and rim:
  EC=EM+(ER-EL)*(1.0-IP*(2*RR/DI)**IX)
The calculations for the crater exterior are presented in Howard(2007)
