 EJECTA_FRACTION_RETAINED 

On small satellites, comets, or asteroids much of the ejecta may
be lost to space.  THis parameter is in the range 0 to 1 governing
how much of the ejecta is retained.  A value slightly greater than
1 could account for the volume of the impactor or increase in volume
of the ejecta by increasing the porosity of the ejecta relative to
the rocks in the excavated crater interior.
