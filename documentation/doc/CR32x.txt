 PEAK_HEIGHT_MULT - CENTRAL PEAK HEIGHT MULTIPLICATIVE FACTOR 

If central peaks are modeled this and the next 3 parameters control
the height and width of the central peak, which is modeled by a
simple cone shape.  A central peak is applied only for crater diameters 
greater than the transition_diameter from simple to complex craters.

The shape parameters are based on statistics collected by Garvin and
colleagues for martian craters (see references in Howard, 2007).

PH - modeled central peak height
PW - modeled central peak width
DI - crater diameter
PHM - central peak height multiplicative factor 
PHE - central peak height exponent (popup CR33x)
PWM - central peak diameter multiplier factor (CR34x popup)
PWE - central peak diameter exponent (CR35x popup)
  PH=PHM*DI**PHE
  PW=PWM*DI**PWE
