***************PARAMETERS FOR USING ACTUAL MARTIAN FRESH CRATERS********** 

If the option is selected to use the topography from real martian craters to
represent new impacts (see CR37x) then a database of topography of real martian
fresh craters is used for newly-generated craters, but only if the crater is
in the size range 15000 to 100000 meter crater diameter.  The use of real craters
gives a cosmetically more realistic simulation, but also the craters tend to have
wider rim regions than geometrically simulated craters. An important limitation
of this capability is that scaled fresh crater topography must be created from
MOLA DEMs for the selected CELL_SIZE for the simulation.  The distribution includes
topographic databases for CELL_SIZE of 1000m, 750m, 500m and 350m.  Because of
the resolution limits of the MOLA topography, use of this dataset is not useful
for CELL_SIZE less than 350m. When a crater diameter for simulation is selected,
either randomly or set by scheduled events, The topography for a natural crater
closest in size to the crater size being simulated is utilized. The orientation of
the real crater DEM (N,S,E.or W) is selected randomly. The natural craters that
have been selected have some background topography, so that the the natural crater
topography exterior to the crater rim is blended with the pre-existing topography
of the simulation. Use of real craters requires several data files be available.
REAL_CRATERS.TXT is the list of the names and diameters of the natural crater
database and must be in the execution directory. The first line of this file
is the absolute file systempath to the directory containing the topographic datasets
for the natural craters.

RM - RADIUS_MAX_INTERIT (popup CR38x)
RU - RADIUS_MAX_USE (popup 39x)
CP - COSINE_POWER (popup 42x)
DI - simulated crater diameter
HP - Pi/2
LR - local radius from crater center

Between the center of the crater and RM*DI/2 the real crater morphology is used
to create the simulated crater after accounting for the mean elevation of the
simulated terrain and compensating for any regional tilt of the real crater topography.
Between RM*DI/2 and RU*DI/2 the influence of the real crater morphology on modifying
the surface elevations drops off as  cos(HP*(LR-RM*DI/2)/((RU-RM)*DI/2))**CP
