 RADIUS_MAX_INHERIT

RM - radius max inherit 
DI/2 - simulated crater radius
This is the distance 2*RM/DI from the crater center outward for
which the real crater morphology is exlusively used to simulate the
crater after compensating for the regional tilt of the real crater
and the mean elevation of the simulated terrain prior to the impact.
