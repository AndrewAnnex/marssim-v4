 RADIUS_MAX_USE

RU - radius_max_use
RM - radius_max_inherit (popup CR38x)
DI - simulated crater diameter
CP - Cosine_power (CR42x popup)
LR - local radial distance from the simulated crater center
HP - Pi/2

Between RM*DI/2 and RU*DI/2 the amount of modification of
the topography prior to the impact on the simulated crater based on
the real crater topography drops off as  cos(HP*(LR-RM*DI/2)/((RU-RM)*DI/2))**CP

See CR36x popup for more details
