 [I] IS_REGOLITH_CRATER  (0= EJECTA IS CONSIDERED TO BE BEDROCK, OTHERWISE
 REGOLITH IF SET TO 1) 
 
If this is set to zero then any modeled crater and its ejecta will be considered to
have the weathering and erosional resistance of bedrock.  If set to 1 then the crater and
ejecta have the erosional characteristics of regolith.  

Large craters are more likely to have exposed bedrock on the crater rim and large rocks in
the ejecta.  In a setting such as on the cratered highlands of Mars or on the Moon smaller
craters and their ejecta may primarily consist of regolith or megaregolith.  The parameter
MINIMUM_HARD_DIAMETER sets the smallest crater diameter that will be considered to be bedrock
if IS_REGOLITH_CRATER is set to 0.
