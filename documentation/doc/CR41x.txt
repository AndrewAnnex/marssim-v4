 MAXIMUM_REAL_CRATER_DIAMETER 

Only craters of size between MINIMUM_REAL_CRATER_DIAMETER
and MAXIMUM_REAL_CRATER_DIAMETER can be simulated using
real fresh crater morphology.  THe default values are 15000 
and 100000 meters, respectively. This diameter range can be
narrowed but not expanded due to limits on compiled martian
fresh crater morphology.
