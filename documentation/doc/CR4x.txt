 [I] CRATER_EDGE_ABORT (0=NO, 1=YES)  

If boundary conditions for the simulation are set to use
fixed matrix edge boundaries (DO_FLOW_BOUNDARIIES=.TRUE.) and
this parameter is set to unity, then an impact whose center
is selected to be outside the simulation domain is skipped.
Otherwise if the boundaries are non-periodic impacts can be
simulated whose center falls outside the matrix edges but whose
rim or ejecta  would extend into the simulation domain ARE allowed
to be simulated so as to minimize edge effects.
