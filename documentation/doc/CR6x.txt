 [I] CORRECT_BIAS - CORRECT MEAN ELEVATION DIFFERENCE AFTER IMPACT
 (1=YES, 0=NO)      

The excavated cavity volume of a typical impact crater and the amount of ejecta
are typically much greater than the volume of the impactor.  By default MARSSIM
enforces that the volume of the rim and ejecta equals the volume of the excavated
cavity.  When the crater impacts onto a high-relief surface such as an existing
crater rim, the default cratering algorithm may not produce exact enforcement of
no net elevation change.  If this switch is set to unity the elevations are adjusted
after the impact to enforce no net elevation change.
