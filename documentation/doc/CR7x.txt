 [I] MAKE_CENTRAL_PEAK - SIMULATE A CENTRAL PEAK (1=YES, 0=NO)

If this is set to unity then for craters whose size is above then
simple-complex transition size will have a simulated central peak.
This is pretty much a cosmetic adjustment, because if fluvial erosion
and sedimentation are simulated, the central peak disappears rapidly.
At present the central peak modeling is runimentary - some
stochasticity in dimensions and actual presence or not should be added
to improve realism.
