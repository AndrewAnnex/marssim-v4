 LARGE_CRATER_DEPTH_SCALE 

Unless real crater topography is selected the
shape of simulated craters is set parametrically.
The default shape parameters are derived by measurement
of fresh craters by Garvin and colleagues using MOLA
topography (see references in Howard(2007)). The shape
parameters are different for large craters (above the
simple to complex size transition) and small craters.
See Howard(2007) about details of the parameterization. 
Both the interior and exterior of the crater (rim and ejecta)
are modeled geometrically as power-functions of distance
from the crater rim.  Parameters CR8x through CR20x control
the shape scaling.  These could be altered, e.g. for the Moon
or icy satellites from appropriate fresh crater morphological
statistics.
DI is crater diameter
H1 = crater depth
KH1 - large_crater_depth_scale or small_crater_depth_scale (popups CR8x and CR13x)
HE - large_crater_depth_exponent or small_crater_depth_exponent (Popups CR9x and CR14x)
  H1=KH1*DI**HE
H2 = rim height
KH2 - large_crater_rim_scale or small_crater_rim_scale (popups CR10x and CR15x) 
RE = large_crater_rim_exponent or small_crater_rim_exponent (popups CR11x or XR16x)
  H2=KH2*DI**RE

M - Exponent controlling the crater interior shape
KM - large_crater_shape_scale or small_crater_shape_scale (popups CR17x or CR19x)
ME - large_crater_shape_exponent or small_crater_shape_exponent (popups CR18x or CR20x)
  M=KM*DI**ME
The crater interior is modeled as:
DH - elevation differential of the interior relative to the
   surrounding terain
RR - distance from the crater center
  DH=(H2-H1) + H1*(2*RR/DI)**M
The crater exterior is modeled as:
  DH=H2*(2*RR/DI)**-N , where N is calculated to conserve net elevation.
