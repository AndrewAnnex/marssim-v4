************************EOLIAN EROSION/DEPOSITION******************** 

This module heuristically models eolian erosion and deposition.  Eolian
deposition is limited to airfall deposition or to that traction transport
and deposition that can be related to local topography.  Erosion and deposition
are related to the degree of local "exposure".  Sites that are convex upward (hills and ridges) 
have positive exposure and may experience erosion or reduced deposition rate.  Sites
that are concave downward (crater interiors, local depressions, valleys) generally receive
net deposition.  Portions of this module related to calculation of exposure are
shared with the accretion and ablation module.

If net eolian deposition occurs at a site, the added material is considered to be regolith.
If net erosion occurs, the calculated erosion rate on bedrock slopes is divided by the 
REGOLITH_CRITICAL_SHEAR_FACTOR.
