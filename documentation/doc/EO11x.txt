 DISTANCE_DECAY_FACTOR

This is the distance in number of cells at which the weighting
of cells at that distance in calculating the exposure index drops
by a factor of two. 

Calculation of eolian deposition and erosion rates is based
on relative elevations extending radially outward from a given
location.  The weighting of the relative elevations decreases
with distance from the given location.  The calculation is based
on summation over radial transects in 8 directions from a given
location:

EL - local elevation
ER - elevation of a point along a transects
EI - the calculated exposure index
DI - distance to the transect point
DF - distance decay factor
WD - weighting_decay_factor
WD=log(0.5)/DF
WT - weighting of a poing at a given distance
WT=exp(WD*DI)
the local exposure index, EI:
EI= sum[(EL-ER)*WT/DI]/sum(WT) taken over all cells out to the 
     maximum_weight_distance
