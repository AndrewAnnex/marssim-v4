 [I] WEIGHTING_CALCULATION_DISTANCE   

This is the maximum radial range, in cells, that the calculation
of exposure index and radiation ablation extend from the location
in question.  The actual radial distance is set by the
maximum_weight_distance, which is the minimum of the 
weighting_calculation_distance amd the number of radial cells at 
which the weigting weight drops below 1.0 percent of its value
at zero distance.
