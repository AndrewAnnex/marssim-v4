 [I] WRITE OUT INITIAL EXPOSURE DATA FILE  

If this switch is set to 1 then after the first calculation of
exposure index for the simulation domain, the exposure index
matrix is written out to a file EXPOSURE.DAT.  This can reveal the
pattern and magnitude of exposure variation accross the simulation
domain to calibrate rate parameters.
