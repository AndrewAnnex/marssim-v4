 EOLIAN_EVENT_PROBABILITY   

THis is how frequently in iterations, that calculation of
eolian erosion and deposition occur.  If fluvial and slope
processes are being modeled, this parameter might be less than
unity, but if only eolian processes are modeled, then this is
generally set to 1.0 .
