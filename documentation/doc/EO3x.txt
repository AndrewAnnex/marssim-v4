 [I] USE_TOTAL_EXPOSURE 

Two routines are used to calculate the local "exposure" which is
then used to determine eolian erosion or deposition rate.  
The function EXPOSURE is called if this switch is set to zero and function TOTAL_EXPOSURE
os called if this is set to 1.
In the EXPOSURE subroutine only cells visible to the local cell are used in computing
   the weighted exposure.
In the TOTAL_EXPOSURE subroutine all cells within the calculation window are used to
   compute exposure.
