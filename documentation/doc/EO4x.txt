 [I] USE DEFAULT_EOLIAN_PROCESS WITH NORMAL-TO-SLOPE DEPOSITION/EROSION

If this switch is set to 1 then erosion and deposition at a cell occurs normal
(perpendicular) to an inclined cell.  Under these circumstances the vertical
elevation change equals the calculated erosion/deposition amount divided by
the cosine of the slope angle.  If this switch is set to zero the cosine
division is not applied.
