************************  FLOW ROUTING AND DRAINAGE AREA ************* 

This routine sets up runoff generation and flow routing through the landscape.
The default is spatially uniform runoff generation, but spatially-varying
runoff can be handled through several methods.  There is also the possibility
of having rivers enter the simulation domain at a fixed location on the simulation
boundaries.  Flow routing can occur under three main scenarios:
   Hyperarid such that all runoff disappears at the floor of depressions.  Although
      this seems unreasonable except for, perhaps, karst terrain, in a landscape 
      with small depressions, modeled sedimentation will fill the depressions and
      an integraded drainage system develops.  This situation occurs when the
      complete runoff index is set to zero.
   Complete runoff has runoff routed through the network without losses except for
      contributing area effects (if selected).  Such effects can occur even without
      runoff losses due to diffusive reduction of flood peaks downstream.  This
      behavior is selected when complete runoff is set to 1 and lake flow routing 
      is turned off.  This option should NOT be set with doubly periodic boundaries
      unless your are modeling Noah's flood.
   Flow routing through depressions with evaporation from ponded water.  This is selected
      by selecting the lake flow option in the MARSSIM_INITIAL_BOUNDARY_CONDTIONS.PRM file
      and selecting complete runoff in this parameter file. The evaporation rate is set
      by the X-Ratio parameter in this parameter file.
