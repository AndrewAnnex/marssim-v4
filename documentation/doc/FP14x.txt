 [I] INTEGER_DIVERGENCE_RANGE (>=1)

This is a stub for calculating the divergence
based on a wider swath of neighboring elevations larger
than the surroinding 8 cells.  A calculation
routine would have to be supplied if a wider range of
elevations (> +/- one cell) is desired for calculation
of divergence. See popup FP9x for details.
