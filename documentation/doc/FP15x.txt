 [I] DO_SPATIAL_RUNOFF - USE SPATIALLY-VARYING RUNOFF COEFFICIENT

This is the most flexible method of specifying spatially-varying runoff.
 If this switch is set a file SPATIAL_VARIATION.DAT file must be
 present in the execution directory. The value of SPATIAL_VARIATION_USE
 must be set to unity in the MARSSIM_INITIAL_BOUNDARY_CONDITIONS.PRM file.
It is a matrix of values whose dimensions 
 correspond to the dimensions of the simulation.  This file must be assembled
 externally to MARSSIM and can be based on a variety of factors, including
 elevation, regional gradient, relative elevation, and topographic divergence.
 Define:
 VMX = maximum value in SPATIAL_VARIATION.DAT
 VMN = mimimum value in SPATIAL_VARIATION.DAT
 HRS = high runoff scale factor (see popup FP17x)
 LRS = low runoff scale factor (see popup FP16x) 
 VAL = the local value of the input matrix
 RUN = the calculated RUNOFF value
 DC = the discharge_constant for routed discharge_constant (see popup FP4x)
 DE = the discharge exponent (see popup FP5x)
 
 AF=(HRS-LRS)*DC/(VMX-VMN)
 BF=(HRS*DC-AF*VMX
 RUN=(VAL*AF+BF)**(1/DE)
