 [I] USE_SEDIMENT_DEPENDENT_RUNOFF  

This is a switch for having runoff from alluvial locations
be modified by a scale factor, sediment_runoff_factor (see popup FP19x)

In some localities more runoff occurs from valley bottoms and
alluvial fans, in part because of infiltration being inhibited
by fines.
