 [I] USE_REGOLITH_DEPTH_DEPENDENT_RUNOFF 

This selects whether runoff is scaled by regolith
depth, with the maximum rate for exposed bedrock. 

BR - runoff scaling for bare bedrock (see popup FP21x))
DR - runoff scaling for deep regolith (see popup FP22x)
DD - rate at which runoff decreases (see pupup FP23x)
NR - nominal runoff
SR - scaled runoff
RD - regolith depth

If bare rock:
  SR = NR * BR
  
Otherwise:
  SR = DR-(DR-BR)*EXP(-DD*RD)
