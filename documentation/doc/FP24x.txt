 [I] USE_SLOPE_DEPENDENT_RUNOFF 

Selection switch for runoff being dependent on slope gradient. 

DR - default runoff value
SR - scaled runoff value
GR - slope gradient
MS - slope gradient having the median runoff value (see popup FP25x)
SF - Slope runoff scale factor (see popup FP26x)

SR = 2.0/(1.0+EXP(-SF*(LOG(GR)-LOG(MS))))
