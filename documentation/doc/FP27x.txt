 [I] NCALCEVAP - ITERATIONS BETWEEN RECALCULATION OF EVAPORATION 

This and the next three parameters govern the calculation of runoff
and lake distribution when modeling of lake evaporation is selected in
MARSSIM_INITIAL_AND_BOUNDARY_CONDITIONS.PRM.  The NCALCEVAP parameter
governs how frequenty the lake evaporation is calculated. This is
generally a low number, defaulting to every iteration. 

See popup FP29x for details.
