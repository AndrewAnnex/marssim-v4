 X-RATIO - A MEASURE OF RELATIVE ARIDITY IN FLOW ROUTING

The X-RATIO defines the relative aridity of flow routing
and lake evaporation when this is selected in the
MARSSIM_INITIAL_AND_BOUNDARY_CONDITIONS.PRM parameter set.
The X-RATIO governs the size and overflowing state of lakes
within depressions.  It is defined as follows:
   EV - Yearly depth of evaporation from lakes
   RF - Fraction of precipitaion on non-submerged uplands that
        contributes to runoff
   PR - Yearly depth of precipitation
	
   X-RATIO = (EV-PR)/(RF*PR)
	
Because this is defined as a ratio the exact values of evaporation, runoff
fraction, and precipitation are not necessary to know.
The minimum value of the X-RATIO is -1.0, when EV=0 and RF=1.
Humid locations with permanent, overflowing lakes are defined by negative X-RATIOS.
During the Pleistocene when the large lakes Lahontan and Bonneville occupied the
U.S. Great Basin, the X-RATIO was in the range 3-5.  At present the X-RATIO in
this basin exceeds 20. For flow routing and lake size prediction for the Great
Basin region see Matsubara and Howard(2009).  For application of the X_Ratio to
Mars see Matsubara and Howard(2011) and Matsubara et al. (2018). In flow routing
an effective evaporation is taken to be X-RATIO+1.0.
