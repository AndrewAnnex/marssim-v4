 [I] RESCALE_DISCHARGES AS A FUNCTION OF CUMULATIVE ROUTED FLOW

This switch is normally set to 1 so that discharges based upon
calculating drainage areas can be scaled downstream to correspond
to natural drainage basins in which geomorphically effective floods
(e.g. the mean annual flood) increase less than linearly with 
contributing area.

UD = Unscaled discharge that is routed downstream 
SD = Scaled discharges
DC = Discharge constant (see popup FP4x)
DE = Discharge exponent (see popup FP5x)

At each location:

SD = DC * UD**DE   (** is exponentiation)
