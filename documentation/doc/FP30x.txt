 EVAPORATION_STANDARD_DEVIATION 

If the X-RATIO is modeled as being constant, keep this
value at 0.0 . If a positive value is given, the X-RATIO
will be recalculated at NCHANGEEVAP intervals.  The 
X-RATIO value is assumed to follow a lognormal distribution

EE - X-RATIO + 1.0   ("effective evaporation")
ESD - Evaporation standard deviation
LEE = log(EE**2/sqrt(ESD**2 + EE**2)  (** is exponentiation)  "Log evaporation mean"
LSD = sqrt(log(ESD**2/EE**2+1.0)  "Log evaporation standard deviation"

Evaporation this scaling follows a lognormal distribution with LEE and LSD parameters

See pupup FP29x for discussion of the X-RATIO
