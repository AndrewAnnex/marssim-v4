 WASHLOAD_FRACTION   
In sediment routing this is the fractional amount of the stream load
that is caried as washload.  If a sediment-laden flow reaches standing
water (lake or ocean), the bedload and suspended load (jointly considered as
bedload) is deposited as topset and foreset deposits and the washload fraction of the
total sediment flux is deposited uniformly in the water body.
