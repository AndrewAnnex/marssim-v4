If the RESCALE DISCHARGES option is used, the DISCHARGE_CONSTANT
and the DISCHARGE_EXPONENTS work together to determine the effective
fluvial discharge as a function of drainage area using the scaling:
DISCHARGE = DISCHARGE_CONSTANT * ROUTED FLOW ** DISCHARGE_EXPONENT
(** is exponentiation)  The DISCHARGE_EXPONENT determines how rapidly
discharge increases downstream.  For flow rates  equivalent
to semi-arid terrestrial landscapes the following provide equivalent
runoff at 7.5 sq. km contributing area, progressing to more arid
conditions down the chart:
DISCHARGE_CONSTANT   DISCHARGE_EXPONENT
   3.5E-7               1.0
   3.5E-5               0.7
   7.56E-4              0.5
   1.69E-2              0.3   

These values are for the mean annual flood, which is assumed to 
correspond to the geomorphically effective discharge for channel
bed erosion and sediment transport.
