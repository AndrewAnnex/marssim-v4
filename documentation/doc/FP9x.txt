 [I] USE_DIVERGENCE_DEPENDENT_RUNOFF (0=NO,1=YES) 

This is one of several means of specifying areally varying
discharges.  If this switch is set, the runoff varies as
a function of local topographic divergence.  For example,
runoff might be specified to be higher in topographically
convergent locations (valley floors or depressions) because
of generally wetter antecedent conditions. The next 5 
parameters (FP10x -- FP14x) control this behavior.  These parameters specify
a broadly lazy S-shaped runoff yield curve. Define:

DS - divergence_scale_parameter (see popup FP13x)
LD - local topographic divergence, based on the surrounding 8 cells
DM - devergence_for_mean_runoff (see popup FP10x)
LD - low_divergence_runoff (see popup FP12x)
HD - high_divergece_runoff (see popup FP11x)
R0 - default runoff value
RD - calculated divergence dependent runoff

T2=DS*(LD-DM)/1.414
T3=0.5*(1+T2/((1+T2**2)**0.5) (** is exponentiation)
RD=LD+(HD-LD)*T3
