************************  Gravel mixture transport  ***********************

This is a specialized module which is loosely connected to the main program, in that
it primarily uses the flow routing procedures and nothing else.  It is based on
Gary Parker's surface-based sediment transport model for gravel streams. It is based
on the Howard et al. (2016) modeling of gravel transport on Earth, Mars, and Titan. The 
was adapted from Parker's Excel workbook "RTe-bookAgDegNormalGravMixPW.xls" at 
(http://hydrolab.illi-nois.edu/people/parkerg/excel_ﬁles.htm) through recoding 
into Fortran and incorporation into MARSSIM. In this use the evolution of slopes
surrounding the modeled channel system is parameterized rather than simulating explicit
slopes.  Each cell is a channel with implicit surrounding slopes. The gravel in transport
is resolved into GRAIN_ARRAY_SIZE categories transported at differential rates. If an
ABRASION_COEF >0 is selected, grain sizes are reduced by abrasion during transport
and loss from the smallest grain size is assumed to be suspended load. Because of the high
computational cost of routing multiple grain sizes the maximum simulation grid size is restricted
to ~ 3500 total cells and very short timesteps are required. For more details see Howard et al. (2016)
in the bibliography.
