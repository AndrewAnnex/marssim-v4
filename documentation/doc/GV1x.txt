 [I] DO_GRAVEL_MIXTURE (0=No/1=Yes)                                             

This switch selects the gravel mixture module and as a byproduct
deselects almost all other fluvial and slope MARSSIM modules 
except flow routing and gradient/flow direction.

If gravel mixture calculations are to be done, the execution
directory must have a file GRAVEL_VALUES.TXT file present which
contains detailed parameter values and grain size distribution
information.

See the Gv0x popup for more details.
