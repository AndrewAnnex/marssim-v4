 [I] STRAIN_CURVE_SIZE                                                          

This determines how many categories are used to transport
individual gravel components based upon their relative proportions
on the bed.  These relative rates are called "strain curves" in
the Parker model.  The model as programmed assumes 36 strain curves,
each consisting of 3 parameters for interpolation of transport rates.
The 36 triplets of values are read from the GRAVEL_VALUES.TXT file
in the execution directory.
