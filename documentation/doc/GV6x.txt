 [I] GRAIN_ARRAY_SIZE

This is the number of grain size categories used
in gravel transport calculations

The next 12 input cells in the GRAVEL_VALUES.TXT file specify the grain size
(in mm) for the category and three entries specifying the cumulative initial
percental representation on the bed.  The first entry is the grain size
the second is the cumulative fraction supplied from upstream, the third
is the cumulative fraction of the surface layer, and the next is the cumulative
fraction for the subsurface. The differential
percentage of the given size is the difference between the
values for the given grain size and the value for the next
smaller size, and the representative grain size is the geometric
mean of the given value and that of the next entry row.
