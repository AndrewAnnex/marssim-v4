************************ GROUNDWATER FLOW ****************************

This module simulates groundwater flow and its geomorphic effects. Two
main substrate models are used: exponentially - decreasing hydraulic
conductivity with depth and a finite-depth aquifer with vertically uniform
hydraulic conductivity. The model uses a grid with the same dimensions as the
main program. Groundwater flow is solved using a finite-difference approach with
overrelaxation. Locations are characterized as being fixed or variable water
table surface.  Locations are designated as fixed_head if the water table intersects
the land surface.  The solution initially assumes a fixed head only at the lowest point in the
topographic matrix. An iterative solution to a steady state solution progresses until
a stable grounwater level is produced with spatially-variable distribution of fixed-head
and non-fixed locations.  In calls to the subroutine after the initial solution is 
obtained the groundwater levels are assumed to be identical to the results from the
previous solution, hastening approach to a new solution after the suface topography
is modified. At present the model assumes spatially uniform hydraulic
conductivity and spatially uniform yearly recharge from the surface. The model assumes
DuPuit flow such that the slope of the water table is small compared to the lateral
dimensions of the cells. At fixed head locations the spatial divergence of lateral
groundwater flux is calculated, which is the discharge per unit area to the surface.
Grounwater levels and groundwater flow rates are assumed to represent steady-state
conditions for the given recharge rate.  The rate of change of surface elevations is
therefore assumed to be slow relative to the timescale of adjustment of the groundwater flow.
For more details see Luo and Howard (2008).

PD - Reference permeability in Darcies (popup GW8x)
MD - metric permeability = PD/1.0E+12
V - water viscosity. (popup GW7x)
DF - water density (from )
g - gravity
HD - reference hydraulic conductivity 
  HD=MD*DF*g/V
DX - cell size (in meters)
GDF - groundwater_depth_scale (popup GW9x)
GSF - groundwater scale factor
  GSF=HD/(2*DX*DX) for constant permeability with depth
  GSF=HD/(2*DX*DX*GDF) for exponential decreasing permeability with depth
EL - surface elevation
IE - initial surface elevation
WE - groundwater water table elevation
TR - lateral transmissivity
EP - power governing permeability decay rate with depth (GW5x popup)
If exponential decay of permeability with depth is not rescaled 
for surface elevation then:
  TR=exp(-GDF*(IE-WE)**EP)
otherwise:
  TR=exp(-GDF*(EL-WE)**EP)
Water table elevation is calculated in 4 directions, E,W,N,S
WN - new water table elevation calculated during an iteration
WO - previous water table iteration
RE - groundwater recharge rate
Let 0 be local value, and E,W,N,S be values at surrounding cells
ELL=TR(0)
CIP=TR(0)+TR(W)
CIM=TR(0)+TR(E)
CJP=TR(0)+TR(S)
CJM=TR(0)+TR(N)
WN(0)=(CIP*WO(W)+CIM*WO(E)+CJP*WO(S)+CJM*WO(N)+RE/GSF)/(CIP+CIM+CJP+CJM)
which is iterated until abs(WN-WO) drops below a specific value, MGE - maximun_groundwater_error (popup GW14x).
Then the groundwater discharge, QX in the horixonatal direction and QY in the vertical direction are:
QX=T(0)*(WN(W)-WN(E))/(DX*DX)
QY=T(0)*(WN(S)-WN(N))/(DX*DX)

Depending upon the switch USE_GROUNDWATER_FLUX (popup GW16x), either the total groundwater flux
or the spatial flux divergence (measuring flow rate from the subsurface to the surface)
is returned to be used to calculate geomorphic effects of groundwater.

The switch SEEPAGE_DIVERGENCE_AVERAGING (popup GW17x)allows 9-point averaging of the flux divergence if selected.

Similar calculations are performed for the situation where constant hydraulic conductivity with depth is
selected
