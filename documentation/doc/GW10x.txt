 GROUNDWATER_FLOW_FRACTION   

When the role of groundwater is envisioned to be transport of
sediment by the groundwater flux from the subsurface to the surface,
this parameter defines the relative roles of surface runoff to groundwater-
derived runoff in sediment transport. If this factor is set to 1.0
then all surface flow derives from groundwater seepage.
