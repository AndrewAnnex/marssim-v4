 INITIAL_GROUNDWATER_DEPTH   

IG = Initial groundwater depth 
GDS - groundwater_depth_scale (popup GW9x)
EP - EPOWER (popup GW12x)
If exponential permeability decay is selected then:
   IG=GDS*IG and DGS is recalculated:
   GDS=-log(0.5)/(GDS**EP)
   
For constant groundwater permeability with depth at start of each iteration:
FH - whether fixed head at given location FH is True if the water table is at the 
     ground surface and False if it is below the surface.
EL - current surface elevation
EI - initial surface elevation
ME - minimum value of EL in simulation matrix
TR - transmissivity term
WE - water table elevation
AT = EL-EI+GDS
IF AT>0:
   FH=False
   WE=EL-AT*IG
   TR=AT*IG
   IF WE<ME then:
     WE=ME
     TR=max(0,ME-IE+DGS)
IF AT<0:
   FH=True
   WE=EL
   TR=0.0
FH at ME = True
