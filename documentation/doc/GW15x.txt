 GROUNDWATER_RELAXATION_COEFFICIENT 

Grundwater flow calculations utilize successive over-
relaxation.  This parameter determines how much overrelaxation
to use.  This value, OR, is within the range 1.0<=OR<2.0 .
Values near 2.0 usually result in more rapid convergence, but
experimentation is the best way to determine the best value for
the fewest calculations required for convergence.
