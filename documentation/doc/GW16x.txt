 [I] USE_GROUNDWATER_FLUX 0=NO 1=YES  

This switch determines whether groundwater flux or groundwater
flux divergence is used to calculate geomorphic effects of
groundwater flow.  Groundwater flux divergence is the rate of
seepage to the surface which is the most obvious variable to use.
That is, set this switch to 0 unless there is a reason to use
groundwater flow rate, which is aquifer depth integrated.

 See popup GW0x for further information.
