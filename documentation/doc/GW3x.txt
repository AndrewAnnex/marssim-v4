 [I] PERMEABILITY_RESCALING 

This switch determines whether the vertical distribution of
permeability is fixed during the simulation (=0) or whether the
vertical distribution is rescaled relative to the surface as
the topography evolves (=1). Unless there is a reason to consider
the permeability to evolve, leave this at 0.  The only case that
seems reasonable to rescale is at locations where the landform
elevation is uncreasing and the rate of decay of permeability
with depth is large.
