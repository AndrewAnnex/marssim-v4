 DARCIES 

This is the lateral permeability of the aquifer if constant
conditions with depth is assumed or the surface permeability
if an exponentially decreasing permeability is assumed.
This is measured in Darcies, which is expressed in cm length
units and converted to meter length units.  Natural rocks
and sediment vary over many orders of magnitude.  For reference
sand has a permeability of about 1 darcy.
