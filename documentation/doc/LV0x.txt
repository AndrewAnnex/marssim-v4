************************LAVAFLOW************************************** 
This module routes lava flows across the surface from one or more locations
and heuristically models flow branching and cessation in manner similar to
Hawaiian basaltic flows.  Several assumptions are made:
1) Individual flows are thin compared to their breadth and length and have
a spatially and temproally constant thickness
2) Emplacement of individual flows occurs over an extended period of time.
3) Most new emplacement of lava occurs at the leading edge of the flow.
4) Lava is erupted from a few, localized, long-lived source vents
5) Flow events cease either due to interruption at the feeding source or
by ponding at its terminus
6) Erosion by lava flows is negligible.
At each iteration lava emplacement occurs at the edges of active flows, At each such
cell the probabily P(ij) of flow from cell i to an adjacent cell j is calculated as:
AT = elapseed time since cell i was innundated by lava
GR = Gradient from cell i to cell j
LGW - Lava_gradient_weight (popup LV10x)
LDW - Lava_duration_weight (LV11x popup)
TH - Lava flow thickness (LV4x popup)
PI - Probability of flow source interruption
   P(ij) = exp(-LDW*AT)*(1-exp(-LGS*GR)
   P(ij) is zero if the gradient to the adjacent cell is uphill or if the adjacent cell is
      part of the active flow.
At each iteration a potential cell is drawn randomly for inundation by lava in proportion to
its probability. Flows cease if there is no positive probability or there is a PI cessation
evant, after which flows reinitiate and extend from the source vent(s).  For more details see
Howard (1999).
The I and J locations of the source lava vents are read from the file LAVA_SOURCES.TXT that must
be present in the execution directory.
