********************MASS FLOW PARAMETERS +++++++++++++  

The mass wasting module simulates landform modification by shallow mass
wasting.  By contrast, this module simulates landform modification by deeper flows (10's
to 100's of meters thick).  The flows are assumed to be sufficiently slowly
moving that momentum effects can be discounted.  Two types of rheology are
modeled: 1) Bingham-like flow with a yield stress and a creep rate varying linearly
with shear stress above the yield stress, and 2) Glen's Law (glacier-like) flow with
no yield stress and shearing rate proportional to stress raised to the Glen's Law 
exponent:
T - applied shear stress
D - strain rate of flow
Y - Bingham yield stress  (popup MF4x)
N - Glen's law exponent (popup MF2x)
F - FLow diffusivity (popup MF3x)                      
1): D = F*(T-Y) if T>Y
2): D = F*T**N

MARSSIM presently considers the flowing material to be regolith, defined broadly as
the surficial layer subject to flow, which could be conceived as ice, dusty ice, fine
particulates, or water-regolith mixtures. The model has several limiting assumptions:
1) the rheology of the mobile regolith is constant with depth beneath the surface
2) The surface slope of the flow is small enough that stresses are hydrostatic
3) The rate of change in flow thickness with distance is small in comparison to 
simulation cell size.
4) Although several parameters are related to possible erosion of the substrate by the
mass flow, these are not implemented or validated in the present model.
The mobile regolith may be generated (or lost) by a number of processes, including volatile 
condensation, exogenous deposition, and weathering, but it is redistributed by mass flow.

Flows into and from a given cell are computed by simple finite-difference equations 
between the surrounding 8 cells. FLows are calculated using depth-integrated flow
equations with flow surface gradients driving the flow.  Several options are available
to calculate the effective depth of the flow between cells (see popup MF15x).  There is
the option to have the simulation time increment be determined by the maximum flow
depth change (See popups MF16x and MF17x).
