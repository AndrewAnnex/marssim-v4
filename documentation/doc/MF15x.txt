 [I]  scheme for determing flow depth at a location 

This multiple-value switch determines how the flow depth
is determined for flows between adjacent cells for Bingham flow

DL = flow depth at local cells
DR - flow depth at the adjacent cell

Values for switch and depth scheme:

1:  Use DL as the flow depth regardless of flow direction
2:  Use DL if the flow is toward the adjacent cell, otherwise DR
3:  Use (DL+DR)/2
0 or >3: A mixed scheme is used:  If the flow is coming from the adjacent cell
     and the local cell's potential yield stress exceeds the critical yield stress then
     the average regolith thickness is used, otherwise the remote cell thickness is used
     If the flow is going to the adjacent cell and the
	 local cell shear stress exceeds the critical yield stress then
     the average thickness is used otherwise the local thickness is used
	 
For Glen's law flow modeling scheme 3 is always used
