 [I] use a time increment scaled to maximum flow depth change: 0=n0,  1=yes

This switch if set to 1 overrides the default timestep for the simulation and resets
the timestep to a value equaling maximum elevation change rate by mass flow set by
the next parameter (pupup FM17x).

See popup MF0x for more details.
