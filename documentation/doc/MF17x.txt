 target maximum elevation change per iteration (meters)  

If switch MF16x is set to 1, then the whole simulation timestep
is adjusted such that the absolute value of the maximum elevation
change produced by mass flow within the simulation domain equals 
this value.

For more information see popup MF0x.
