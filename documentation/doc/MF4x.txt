 Delta_thickness for Bingham flow 
 
 This is a scaling parameter defining the critical
 yield stress for Bingham flow in units of meters.  
 DT - delta thickness
 RHO - mass flow material density
 g - gravity
 TC - critical yield stress for Bingham flow
 
 DT = TC/(RHO*g)
 Thus:
 TC=DT*RHO*g
