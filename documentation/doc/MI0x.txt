************************  INITIAL AND BOUNDARY CONDITIONS  ***********************  
This parameter file contains switches to turn simulation modules on or off. For some
processes (groundwater flow for example) the switch is in the process-specific
parameter file.
Also included are:
    Parameters controlling the size and duration of the simulation and unit scaling
    Parameters controlling the interation time increment
    Parameters related to monitoring and debugging the simulation
    Boundary conditions: Fixed, Periodic, Changing in elevation
    Parameters related to time-varying process rates and modeled events during the simulation
    Parameters controlling the frequency of saving of intermediate simulation results
    Parameters controlling the selection of output files
    Parameters selecting steady or stochastic forcing of discharge and rock erodibility
    Parameters related to the occurrence of surface deformation
    Whether there is an oceanic baselevel that varies temporally in elevation
    Whether there is a masking file prohibiting erosional processes in certain locations
	
In general the length dimensions for numerical parameters are in meters.  The time unit for fluvial
flows and sediment transport rates is in seconds, but units for temporal changes ant simulation
timescales are generally in years.  Masses are in kilograms.
	
In the various parameter files, a [I] at the beginning of the parameter description indicates
an integer value is required, otherwise a floating-point value is expected.

IF VALUES ARE CHANGED FOR PARAMETER AND SWITCH VALUES FOR ANY OF THE PARAMETER FILES BE
SURE TO SAVE THE FILE BY CLICKING ON THE GREEN "SAVE" BUTTON AT THE BOTTOM OF THE EDITING
WINDOW.  THIS IS NOT DONE AUTOMATICALLY, ALTHOUGH A BACKUP FILE IS WRITTEN EACH TIME A 
PARAMETER FILE IS READ.
