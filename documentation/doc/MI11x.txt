 [I] SWITCH FOR MASS FLOW (0=NO, 1=YES) 

In contrast to shallow mass wasting on regolith
and bedrock slopes, this switch turns on deep
mass flows.  Two types of rheology are permitted,
Bingham flows with a critical shear stress and
Glen's Law flow with a specified exponent.  These
flows are assumed to relatively slow, so that inertial
forces are not considered.  They also assume stresses
proportional to the flow depth, and thus are limited to
flow situations where the flow depth is shallow compared
to the overall relief.  Parameters are read from
MASS_FLOW.PRM.
