 [I] MX, NUMBER OF CELLS IN THE X DIRECTION

This sets the number of simulation cells in the
lateral direction, MX.  Cell numbers go from 1
to MX to the right (East).  The mumber of cells
in the input elevation file (INELEV.DAT) or any
other spatially distributed input file must have
the same number of lateral cells .
