 [I] MY, NUMBER OF CELLS IN THE Y DIRECTION                                     

This sets the number of simulation cells in the
vertical direction, MY.  Cell numbers go from 1
to MY downward (South).  The mumber of cells
in the input elevation file (INELEV.DAT)  or any
other spatially distributed input file must have
the same number of vertical cells.
