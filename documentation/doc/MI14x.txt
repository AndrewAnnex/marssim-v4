 [I] MZ, NUMBER OF CELLS IN THE Z DIRECTION IF BEDROCK STRATIGRAPHY IS MODELED

If a 3-D matrix of bedrock erodibility is input, this specifies the number
of cells, with 1 being the initial surface and MZ being the deepest cell.
This number has no meaning if bedrock weathering potential and erosional resistance
is uniform with depth.
