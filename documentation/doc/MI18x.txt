 [I] SWITCH FOR TIME-VARYING SIMULATION PARAMETERS (1=YES, 0=N0) 

IF time-varying behavior is desired then a file INRATES.DAT must be present
in the simulation directory.  It has a structure as outlined in the
READ_INPUT_PARAMETERS in the initial_and_boundary_conditions.f90 source
file starting at line ~1017.  The actual changes in values occur at iteration
values specified in INRATES.DAT. The actual changes in the parameters are made
in the DETERMINE_EROSION_RATE subroutine.  A limited number of parameters
can be changed as presently programmed in this subroutine. To change
the selection of values, this subroutine would be altered and the program
recompiled.  This approach to parameter variation has less flexibility than
the EVENTS procedures.
