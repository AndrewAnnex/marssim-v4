 [I] DO_EVENTS (0 FOR STEADY BOUNDARY CONDITIONS DURING SIMULATION, 
IF SPECIFIC EVENTS ARE TO BE PROGRAMMED.

This is a flexible approach to produce time-varying behavior during
program execution.  This approach has been used, for example, to simulate impact
craters occurring at specified times, locations, with assigned
crater sizes.  Another use in Howard and Tierney (2012) has implemented wave
planation events in coastal landforms. The events can be specified to 
occur as specific times or as iteration numbers, as read from EVENTS.PRM. 

THe downside is that the actions performed at the specific times must
be programmed within the subroutine MAKE_EVENT in the 
initial_and_boundary_conditions.f90 source file and the program 
recompiled. Some examples and suggestions are given in the
MAKE_EVENTS subroutine.

Of course, a more laborious method would be to sequence a number of
simulation runs with different parameters or after change of the output
topography or other state variables from the preceeding run.
