 DEFAULT_CHANNEL_TIMESTEP 

This is the first of several parameters governing
the simulation timestep per iteration. The default
approach for landcape modeling dominated by fluvial
erosion and mass wasting is to have the timestep be
governed by the potential rate of erosion to minimize
the possibility of instability.  Fluvial erosion is one
of the more finicky processes and it is the most limiting
factor in most cases.  The downside to this method of
determining the timestep is that the timesteps may vary 
during the simulation. 

In general, for all of the parameters controling timesteps
the usual strategy is to hunt for the largest value that
does not make the program become unstable (e.g., elevations
increasing or decreasing without limet, or NaN numbers
resulting from division by zero or exponentiation by very
large numbers). The upside is that instabilities usually
arise early in a simulation.
