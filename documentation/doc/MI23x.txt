 [I] SWITCH FOR USING SEDIMENT YIELD TIMESTEP SCALING (0=NO, 1=YES) 

Sediment routing is very sensitive to the imposed sediment load from
upstream erosion.  If a variable discharge is used and/or when upstream
drainage patterns change abruptly very large transient sediment loads can
cause pronounced ridges of deposition on fan and delta surfaces. If this
switch is set to 1 the calculated timestep will be reduced for sediment
yields exceeding the value of the SEDIMENT YIELD TIMESTEP FACTOR (the
next parameter in the parameter file).  This approach has not been well
tested, and is probably best avoided unless you want to experiment with
values or work with the code.
