 [I] VERTICAL SIZE (NY) OF DEBUGGING WINDOW (IF USED) 

 The four debugging locations set a window for printing of
execution information within the given window for purposes
of debugging code or parameter values. This is rarely used and 
very large volumes of data can be output. THis is used  concert
with the do-debugging switch.
