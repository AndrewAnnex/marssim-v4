 [I] DO DEBUGGING PRINTOUT (0=NO, 1=YES)                                        

The four debugging locations set a window for printing of
execution information within the given window for purposes
of debugging code or parameter values. This is rarely used and 
very large volumes of data can be output. This is used  concert
with the do-debugging switch.  If used, modify the file
write_debug_information.f90 to output the desired information.
The timing and model circumstances under which debug information
is written must be set within the particular routines for which data
is to be produced or iteration times set in the main_program.f90 
iteration cycling.
