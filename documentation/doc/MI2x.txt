[I] NEW SIMULATION (1=YES, 0=NO)
    Most runs will likely be new simulations.
    The time will be set to TIME at start of simulation (usually 0.0)
    The starting iteration number is usually set to 0
    Starting elevations are read from INELEV.DAT
    The INITIAL_REGOLITH_THICKNESS will be set from the input file
       WEATHERING_PARAMETERS.PRM
    
For continuation runs the program will read state variables from the files
produced by the previous simulation run:
    FINAL_BEDROCK.DAT, FINLAL_SEDCOVER.DAT, fINAL_SEDBASE.DAT,
    fINAL_REGOLITH.DAT, and FINAL_ELEVATION.DAT

However, be sure to set the initial time and iteration number to
correspond to the final values during the previous simulation as read from
BASIN.LST
