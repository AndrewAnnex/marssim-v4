 [I] PRINT OUT MORPHOMETRIC STATISTICS (0=NO, 1=YES) - PRIMARILY FOR  
FLUVIALLY ERODED LANDSCAPES

If this switch is set to unity a large set of morphometric statistics will
be output, including information on slope profiles, drainage density, channel
profiles, concavity and convexity of landforms, etc.  See the paper by
Howard and Tierney (2012) for a summary of these statistics and their use
in characterizing landscapes.  These are most useful for simulations involving
only fluvial, mass wasting, and weathering processes in eroding portions of
the landscape.
