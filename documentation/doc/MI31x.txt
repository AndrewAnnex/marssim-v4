 [I] SHADE_BORDER_INDEX (0=NO, 1=YES) IF I OR J DIMENSIONS ARE PERIODIC
 APPENDS OPPOSITE SIDE BORDER IN SHADED RELIEF IMAGES

When periodic boundaries are used for x or y or both sets of boundaries setting
this switch will extend the lateral boundaries of shaded relief images to include
a strip from the opposite boundary.  This is particularly useful to permit visualization
of the landscape near the periodic boundaries and to be able to select regions for
figures that cross the simulation edges.
