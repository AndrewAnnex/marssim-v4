 [I] USE A FIXED SUN ANGLE IN SHADED RELIEF IMAGES, OTHERWISE CALCULATED
 FOR GRAZING ILLUMINATION            

Shaded relief images are useful for visualizing the progress of landform
changes during a simulation.  If this switch is NOT set, then the default
is to output images using a sun angle on the steepest slope facing away from 
the sun (east-facing slopes).  This assures each image shows detail on all
slopes.  However, as landscapes evolve the maximum slope steepness will increase
or decrease, so that the computed sun angle changes.  If the intent is to use a long
sequence of images to generate a movie of the landform evolution, then a fixed sun
angle may be preferable, which will occur if this switch is set.  The next
parameter gives the gradient of the sun angle (Sunrise is a gradient of zero).
