 [I] INDEX FOR A HORIZONTAL LOWER BOUNDARY (AT J=MY) (0=NO, 1=YES)  

This and the next 5 switches define the boundary conditions for
the simulation.  A horixontal lower boundary is usually for simulations
involving that boundary as a base level control.  It should not be
paired with a y-periodic boundary.
