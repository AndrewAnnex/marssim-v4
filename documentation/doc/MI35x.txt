 RATE OF LOWERING OF LOWER BOUNDARY (IN M/YR) POSITIVE FOR OWNCUTTING, 
 USED ONLY IF HORIZONTAL LOWER BOUNDARY IS SPECIFIED

This is used with the switch for a horizontal lower boundary being set (to 1).
It governs the rate of lowering (or raising) of the boundary, expressed as meters
per year. 

Erosion rates on Earth vary from less than 0.00001 to more than 0.01 m/yr.  The
highest rates occur only in very rapidly uplifting mountain chains.  For example,
the rate of erosion in the Appalachian region of the eastern United States is
about 0.00003, and the rates in the coastal ranges of the U.S. pacific coast
is about 0.001.  Rates even lower than the low value quoted can characterize
central portions of continental stable platforms (e.g. Australia) under arid conditions.
