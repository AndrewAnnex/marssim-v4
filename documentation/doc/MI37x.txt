 [I] INDEX FOR HORIZONTAL PERIODIC BOUNDARY (ON I AXIS) (0=NO, 1=YES 

This forces the left and right boundaries to be coupled, so that they
essentially are identical and flows of water and mass wasting materials
can be transported across the boundary.  This can be combinded with the
horizontal lower boundary to reduce the effects of lateral boundaries on
landform evolution.  If this switch is not set (set to 0) the lateral boundaries
are no-flux, such that no water sediment, or mass wasting crosses the boundary.
