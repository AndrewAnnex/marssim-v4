 [I] INDEX FOR VERTICAL PERIODIC BOUNDARY (ON J AXIS) (0=NO, 1=YES) 

If this switch is set the top and bottom boundaries are periodic in the
same way that horizontal periodic boundaries are treated.  If both
horizontal and vertical periodic boundaries are set then care must be taken
to keep fluvial flows having no exit and thus flooding the domain.  The
two ways to accomplish this is either 1) set the parameter COMPLETE RUNOFF INDEX
in the FLOW_PARAMETERS.PRM file to zero (depressions remain dry) or 2) to set
the COMPLETE RUNOFF INDEX to 1, set the switch for LAKE EVAPORATION MODELING
to 1, and use a X-RATIO parameter high enough to compensate for upland runoff.
