 [I] INDEX FOR FIXED EXTERNAL BOUNDARIES (0=NO, 1=YES) 

This is a special boundary configuration used mostly to simulate
evolution of targeted natural landscapes using actual or retrodicted
initial topography (See, for example, Matsubara et al, 2018).  For this situation
the simulation domain boundaries remain fixed in elevation.  Water, sediment,
and mass wasted regolith can exit the domain but not enter (sort of a
topologically inverted "roach hotel").  If this is set then neither the
horizontal or vertical boundaries can be periodic.
