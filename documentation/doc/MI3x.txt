[I] SWITCH FOR FLUVIAL AND SLOPE MODELING (0=NO, 1=YES)

This is the first of several switches that determine which modules
to include and which matrices to allocate (initialize)

Simulations involving runoff, fluvial processes, and mass wasting
need to set this switch to 1 for yes.  These switches should
be indicated as an integer such that 0 = No; 1 = yes

When fluvial processes are modeled, the iteration temporal duration
is usually governed by the fluvial erosion. The fluvial processe
generally govern the speed of the simulation, and thus set realistic
limits to the spatial dimensions of the simulation domain and the 
duration of the simulation. Of the fluvial modeled processes sediment
routing, if used, consumes the greatist time.  Simulations using up to
1 million cells usually can be completed in no more than a few days,
depending upon the total number of iterations.
