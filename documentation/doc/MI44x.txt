 MAXIMUM ELAPSED TIME (IN YEARS) (STOPS SIMULATION AND PRINT RESULTS
IF EQUALLED)

The simulation tests both for reaching the maximum iteration number or
the maximum elapsed time and stops the simulation and writes output files.
If control by number of iterations is desired, set the maximum elapsed time
to a large value, or vice-versa for time control.
