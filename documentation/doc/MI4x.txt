[I] SWITCH FOR IMPACT CRATER MODELING (0=NO, 1=YES)

If impact cratering is to be included in a simulation,
set this to 1 (yes)

This module can be run without the fluvial and slope module.
Under these contitions large matrix dimensions and tens of thousands
of impacts can be quickly simulated.

Most of the relevant parameters are in the CRATERING_PARAMETERS.PRM file.
There are options to model craters geometrically or as actual martian 
fresh craters.
Cratering can occur randomly in time and space with a specified probability
or individual impacts can be programmed in time and space using the EVENTS method.
