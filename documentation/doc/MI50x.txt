CONVERGENCE FACTOR FOR DEFINING THE HEAD OF A CHANNEL

MARSSIM considers each cell to be potentially modified by both fluvial
and mass wasting processes during each iteration.  In consequence the drainage
density could be considered infinite.  The program will, however, define the
"channel" heads of the stream network to correspond to a specific ratio of 
topographic convergence to the mean topographic gradient.  This parameter
specifies the critical value of convergence.  See Howard(1994) for more details.
