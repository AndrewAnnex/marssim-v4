 [I] NUMBER OF ITERATIONS BETWEEN OUTPUT OF SHADED RELIEF AND BINARY 
ELEVATION FILES.

A shaded relief portable grey map (PGM) file is created at the frequency
set by this parameter, with each image numbered sequentially. This is
useful for monitoring the progress of the simulation as well as being
a summary of changes in relief during the simulation.  In addition, the
most recent state is also presented in ATPRESENT.PGM, which is updated 
at the frequency set by this parameter.  For the purpose of documenting
the evolution of the landscape a value of a few hundred iterations is 
generally sufficient.  If, however, a movie of the topographic evolution
is desired to be made, output of images every few iterations is optimal.
