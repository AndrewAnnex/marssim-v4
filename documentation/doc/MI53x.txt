 [I] INTERVAL BETWEEN RECALCULATION OF TOPOGRAPHIC DIVERGENCE 

The rate of rock weathering can depend upon the convexity or concavity
of the surface.  This parameter determines the interval, in iterations,
between recalculating the divergence.  It can be left at a few iterations
to provide some computation time savings.
