************************ RANDOM VARIATION OF SIMULATION PARAMETERS ***

The default for simulations is to have constant parameter values during
the simulation.  The options for time-varying or event-driven variations
in parameters or boundary conditions are available, but these are generally
meant to be applied at infrequent intervals.  Another option is to have
the discharges or fluvial critical shear conditions vary randomly from 
iteration to iteration.  The parameters below provide this option.
