 [I] INDEX FOR USE OF A RANDOMLY-VARYING CRITICAL SHEAR FOR FLUVIAL 
EROSION (0 - NO, 1 - YES) 

If this switch is set, the critical shear for fluvial erosion follows a
lognormal distribution, with the lognormal standard deviation read two
lines below, and the mean value is read from BEDROCK_CHANNEL_PARAMETERS.PRM.
Note, this creates a temporal variation and applies spatially uniformly.
Spatial variation in bedrock erosibility would generally be set by reading
in a 3-D matrix of rock resistance.
