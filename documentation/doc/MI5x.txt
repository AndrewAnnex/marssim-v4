[I] SWITCH FOR LAVA FLOW MODELING (0=NO, 1=YES)

This is a strongly heuristic model, using lava
sources at specific locations. The model is intended
to produce flows similar in morphology to those in basaltic 
terrains, such as the Hawaiian islands and the martian
Tharsis region. 

Details about the lava flow modeling are found in:

     martian cratered terrain. 30th Lunar and Planetary
     Science Conference, Abstract 1112.
