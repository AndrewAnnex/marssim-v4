 OMEGA - WEIGHTING OF INFLUENCE OF LAST ITERATION VALUE IN TEMPORAL VARIATION
 (GENERALLY 0.5 TO 1.0, WITH 1.0 BEING NO PAST INFLUENCE)

The omega parameter affects the timescale of discharge variation.  This
parameter should have a value, OW such that 1>=OW>0 .  If the value is 
unity the discharge is based entirely on the current random value return if
it is less than unity the value used is OW*V + (1-OW)* PV, where V is the
randomly calculated balue and PV is the value from the previous iteration.
THe closer omega is to zero the slower tte discarge varies and the smaller
the range of variation.
