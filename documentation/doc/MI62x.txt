 [I] INDEX TO VERTICALLY DEFORM SURFACE DURING SIMULATION (1=YES, 0=NO)

If this is set then vertical rock deformation will occur during the simulation.
At present this is just a stub that has no effect.  If deformation is desired,
the subroutine BOUNDAY_CONDITIONS in Initial_and_boundary_conditions.f90 must be
programmed to provide values of DEFORMATION(I,J) spatial and temporal variations
during the simulation.
