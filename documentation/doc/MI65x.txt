 [I] INDEX FOR TEMPORAL VARIATION IN GLOBAL OCEAN LEVEL (0=NO, 1=YES)
(A FILE SPECIFYING TEMPORAL VASRIATION MUST BE SUPPLIED}


If this switch is set then the elevation of a shoreline within the simulation
domain varies through time. If this switch is set then a file must be
supplied: OCEANLEVELS.DAT.  It consists of paired values in each line:
OCEAN_RECALCULATION_TIMES(I) OCEAN_LEVELS (I) for as many timesteps of
ocean variation are programmed.  The first value is the simulation time when
the ocean level is to be changed and the second value is the corresponding
elevation level.  See Howard and Tierney (2012) for an example of using this
option.

For a fixed oceanlevel set the ocean level in the ALLUVIAL_CHANNELS_PARAMETER>PRM File.

If runoff with lake evaporation is modeled lakes with time-varying levels are 
automaticall implemented independent of this switch value..
