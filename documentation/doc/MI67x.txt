 [I] USE EROSION_MASK (0=NO,1=YES)

 It this switch is set then a bimary file BASE_IMAGE_EXLUDE.RAW
 must be present in the working directory This file must have the
 same dimensions as the simulation domain with MY rows and MX columns of
 single byte data (0-255 values).  If these bytes have a value >128 then
 erosional processes occur at that location, otherwise they are disallowed (masked).
 As implemented, runoff is generated across the entire simulation domain, but
 fluvial and mass wasting processes occur only in the unmasked areas.
 The file has no header, just being MX*MY bytes of data.
 
 This is a very specialized capability and will not be used in most cases.
