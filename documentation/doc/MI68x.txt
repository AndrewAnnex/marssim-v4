 [I] USE SPATIAL VARIATION IN RUNOFF AND/OR WEATHERING

If this switch is set there must be a file SPATIAL_VARIATION.DAT in the
execution directory.  It should follow the format of the INELEV.DAT file
with a first line giving the I and J dimensions of the matrix, and the 
values following arranged as with INELEV.DAT.
The values express relative intensities relative to 1.0, which should be
approximately the mean value of the input matrix.
It is a matrix of values whose dimensions 
 correspond to the dimensions of the simulation.  This file must be assembled
 externally to MARSSIM and can be based on a variety of factors, including
 elevation, regional gradient, relative elevation, and topographic divergence.
In order to use the spatial variation for flow routing, the variable 
SPATIAL_RUNOFF_USE must be set to unity in the FLOW_PARAMETERS.PRM file.
In order to use the spatial variation for weathering rate, the variable
SPATIAL_WEATHER_USE must be set to unity in the WEATHERING_PARAMETERS.PRM file.
Both the flow routing and weathering routines read in minimum and maximum
values for rate adjustment which are used to scale the range of variation
as expressed in the SPATIAL_VARIATION matrix.  Both weathering variation
and runoff variation can be used simultaneously with independent scale ranges
but based on the relative values in the SPATIAL_VARIATION matrix.
