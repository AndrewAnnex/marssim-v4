[I] SWITCH FOR EOLIAN EROSION/DEPOSITION MODELING (0=NO, 1=YES)

Eolian processes are simulated only as broad-scale erosion or
deposition.  Tractive transport and bedforms (ripples, dunes)
are not simulated.  Eolian erosion and deposition rates are modeled
in terms of the "exposure" of a location in the landscape, generally
such that areas with high exposure (ridges, crater rims, etc.) are gradually
eroded in proportion to an exposure index, whereas areas with low or negative
exposure (e.g., valleys, crater interiors) have deposition in proportion to
their negative exposure.

This module can be run independently of the fluvial and slope module.
