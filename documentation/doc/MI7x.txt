[I] SWITCH FOR A GLOBAL OCEAN LEVEL (0=NO, 1=YES)

If this is set to Yes, then locations below the ocean
level are modeled as submerged sedimentary processes.
Only deltaic foreset bed deposition of bedload 
and distributed bottomset deposition of suspended
load are modeled.

The ocean elevation is read from the ALLUVIAL_CHANNEL_
PARAMETERS.PRM file.

Deltaic and bottomset deposition in lakes also can be modeled
if the Lake Evaporation modeling is selected.
