 [I] SWITCH FOR LAKE EVAPORATION MODELING (0=NO, 1=YES)

This switch turns on flow routing involving balancing between
runoff generation and evaporation from ponded/lake surfaces
to determine the size of lakes in depressions and any overflow
from the lakes that is routed further downstream.  Use of this
routine also requires that the USEWET parameter in FLOW_ROUTING.PRM
be set to unity.
