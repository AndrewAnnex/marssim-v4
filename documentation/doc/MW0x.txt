************************  MASS WASTING PARAMETERS ********************

The mass wasting routine includes four models of downslope mass wasting on regoltith-mantled slopes.
Creep rate is evaluated in 8 directions in and out of each cell and summed.
Four main models are implemented:

1) Using the Howard (1994) slope model:
    KS - slope diffusivity (popup MW2x)
	KF - rapid creep diffusivity (popup MW11x)
    SG - slope gradient
    SC - critical slope gradient (popup MW8x) 
    SE - slope gradient exponent (popup MW9x)
    DF - Mass wasting flux per unit slope width
	RD - Regolith depth
	CD - creep depth constant (MW7x popup)
	
	DF - KS*SG + KF/(1 - (SG/SC)**SE)

2) Roering et al. (1999,WRR): 

    DF = KS*SG/(1 - (SG/SC)**2)
	
3) Simple diffusion
    
	DF = KS*SG
	
4) Depth-dependent creep

    DF = (1-exp(-KS*RD))*SG/(1-(SG/SC)**2)
