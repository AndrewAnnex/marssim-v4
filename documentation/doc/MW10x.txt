  MAXIMUM_DIFFUSIVITY_INCREASE PARAMETER 

In order to keep mass wasting rates from becoming infinite.
This parameter sets an upper limit to
the rate of mass wasting. If the gradient gets very close to the critical
slope gradient then the maximum diffusivity, MD, is set to:

 KF - the failure mass diffusivity using the Howard(1994) mass wasting model 
 ND - the maximum diffusivity increase parameter
 SGE - the slope gradient exponent 
 MD - maximum slope diffusivity
 SC - the critical slope gradient
 KS - the slope diffusivity
 
 For the Howard (1994) model:

    MD = KF*(1/ND -1) which applies to slope gradients greater than SC*(1-ND)**(1/SGE)
	
 For the Roering et al model:
 
    MD = KS*(1/ND-1) which applies to slope gradients greater than SC*(1-ND)**0.5
