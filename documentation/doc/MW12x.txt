 [I] DO ROUTE REGOLITH OVER BEDROCK  

On bare bedrock slopes mass wasting occurs rapidly enough
to keep the slope free from appreciable accumulation of regolith.
In this model any debris crossing bedrock slopes is routed downslope
instantly (relative to the simulation timescale) until it reaches a regolith-covered
location or standing water,where it is deposited.  
The debris that is routed can come from regolith
routed onto a bedrock slope from above and from the regolith generated by
weathering during the iteration timestep. This routing occurs if
this switch is set.  Otherwise regolith and weathered debris is diffusively
mass-wasted in the same manner as on regolith slopes.  This switch is
usually set to unity to allow debris routing.
