 AVALANCHE_RATE_COEFFICIENT

Steep bedrock mountain slopes often develop chutes presumably
due to cascades or avalanches of frost-weathered bedrock as as
result of advective scour.  If this module is selected in
MARSSIM_INITIAL_BOUNDARY_CONDITIONS.PRM, then this parameter
is the rate multiplyer for avalanche advection.  This is an
experimental module that has only been tested in a planetary
context.  The avalance erosion builds upon the bedrock mass
wasting routing procedures.  The model is parameterized as:

   AF - flux of routed mass wasted material at given bedrock /location
        from previous iteration
   LS - local slope gradient
   ARD - avalanche_rate_coefficient 
   AFE - avalanche_flux_exponent (popup MW15x)
   ASE - avalanche_slope_exponent (popup MW14x)
   ACV - avalanche_critical_value (popup MW16x)
   AER - avalanche_erosion_rate
   
   AER = ARD * AF**AFE * LS**ASE - ACV (if a posiitive value)
