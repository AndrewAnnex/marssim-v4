 ALVCREEPFAC (PROPORTION OF SLOPE CONSTANT IN ALLUVIAL CREEP)

This factor determines the creep diffusivity in alluvial locations, ranging
from 0 for no mass wasting to 1.0 for rate equality for regolith slopes to
values >1 for enhanced diffusivity on alluvial surfaces. A value greater than
1.0 can help to smooth out irregulatities on depostional surfaces such as 
alluvial fans produced by the sediment routing procedure.
