 [I] USE DEPTH!DEPENDENT CREEP (0=N0, 1=YES) 

If this switch is set to 1 then the regolith depth-dependent
creep model is used.  This can possibly improve the realizm
of mass wasting modeling when regolith becomes very thin.  The
default, when this is not selected is that mass wasting rates
do not decrease for very thin soils.   See Roering (2009 GSAB).

  See MW0x popup for more details.
