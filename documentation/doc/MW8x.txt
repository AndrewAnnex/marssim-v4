  CRITICAL_SLOPE_GRADIENT  

If a critical gradient is selected this is the gradient value
for which the mass wasting approaches a very large value.  This
effectively sets a limit of slope steepness for regolith-covered
slopes.  Above this gradient all slopes are bedrock. This critical
gradient is typically equal to or greater than the angle of repose
for cohesionless debris.
