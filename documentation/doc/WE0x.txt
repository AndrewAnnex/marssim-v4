************************  REGOLITH WEATHERING PARAMETERS ************* 

These parameters govern rock weathering into regolith.  In addition to the
parameters in this file, the rate of rock weathering can also be subject
to weathering by groundwater seepage and solar erosion and mass flow erosion

The default weathering can be based on 1- or 2-term weathering

RWR - the rock weathering rate for bare bedrock (WE1x popup)
WDR - the default rate that weathering decreases with regolith thickness (WE2x popup)
RW2 - weathering term 2 (WE6x popup)
WD2 - weathering decay rate 2 (WE7x popup)
DEL-R - the increase in regolith thickness per year
RT - regolith thickness
VCC - volume change coefficing - how much regolith is produced per unit rock weathering
      (can be greater or less than 1)  (WE4x popup)
DV - term for effect of topographic divergence on weathering rate (WE13x popup)
COS - inverse cosine of slope correction for weathering being perpendicular to slope
GCR - an enhanced weathering rate for steep bedrock slopes
LRR - local rock resistance to weathering
LTD - local topographic divergence 
The default weathering rate for regolith-covered slopes is:
DEL-R = VCC*(RWR*EXP(-WDR*RT) - RW2*EXP(-WD2*RT))/(COS*LRR)
WM - a scaling factor for GCR (WE12x popup)

This produces a humped regolith production function if RWR>WR2 and WDR<WD2
On bedrock slopes where mass wasting and fluvial erosion have exceeded RWR then
   weathered bedrock production = RWR*(exp(-WD2*RT) + WM*GCR)
The GCR term (if selected) approaches a very large value at a critical slope gradient  > critical 
   gradient for regolith(WE11x popup).  The weathered bedrock production on bedrock slopes is routed downslope
   in the mass wasting routine, and regolith is also diffused by mass wasting.
