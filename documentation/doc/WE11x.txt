 CRITICAL_BEDROCK_GRADIENT  

This is a gradient at which the rock weathering increases nearly
without limit.  It is included as a type of "safety valve" to keep
rock slopes from approaching or exceeding vertical, which the program
cannot handle.  This value should be large, at some value well above
1.0 (45 degrees), such as 3.0 . Rock that is weathered by this process
is routed downstream in the mass wasting module.
