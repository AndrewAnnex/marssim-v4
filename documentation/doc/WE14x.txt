 [I] READREGOLITH (>0 read in initial regolith thickness) 

This is a switch allowing initial regolith thicknesses to be read in from
the file INREG.DAT, which must be in the execution directory.  This file
has the dimensions of the simulation domain.  This can be useful for initiating or continuing
a run other than by the default switch for continuation run, which also reads in
regolith thickness from the prior run.
