 [I] SPATIAL_WEATHERING_USE - 0 = NO, 1 = YES

This determines whether the weathering rates will vary spatially according
to the values read into SPATIAL_VARIATION.DAT.  The value of SPATIAL_VARIATION_USE
must be set to unity in the MARSSIM_INITIAL_BOUNDARY_CONDITIONS.PRM file.
The values input in this matrix are scaled by the LOW_WEATGHERING_SCALE and
HIGH_WEATHERING_SCALE to set the maximum and minimum weathering rates as a multiplicative
factor applied to ROCK_WEATHERING_RATE.
Define:
 VMX = maximum value in SPATIAL_VARIATION.DAT
 VMN = mimimum value in SPATIAL_VARIATION.DAT
 HWS = high weathering scale factor (see popup WE16x)
 LWS = low weathering scale factor (see popup WE17x) 
 VAL = the local value of the input matrix
 WEA = the default bedrock weathering rate (see popup WE1x.dat
 LOC = the local bedrock weathering rate
 AVAL = (HWS-LWS)/(VMX-VMN)
 BVAL = LWS-AVAL*VMN
 LOC= WEA*(VAL*AVAL-BVAL)

The local vaiues are reduced when there is a regolith cover
