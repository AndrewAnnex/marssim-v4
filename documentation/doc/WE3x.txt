 INITIAL_REGOLITH_THICKNESS 

This is the initial regolith thickness at the start of the simulation.
Because of threshold effects on weathering, erosion, and mass wasting
associated with exposed bedrock, it is usually desirable to have a positive
regolith thickness that is small compared to characteristic landform relief, say
1 meter.
