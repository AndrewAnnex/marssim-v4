 VOLUME_CHANGE_COEFFICIENT DUE TO CONVERSION OF BEDROCK TO REGOLITH 

This is the relative change in volume produced by rock weathering.
A value of 1.0 means equal volume of regolith for equal volume of weathering,
and values <1.0 mean less volume of regolith is produced per unit rock weathering.
