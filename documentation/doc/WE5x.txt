 [I] USE TWO_TERM_WEATHERING (0=NO, 1=YES)   

This switch determines whether two-term weathering is assumed, with
the possibility of a humped production function (weathering rate for
a certain range of regolith cover greater than that for bare rock).  
A humped production function tends to introduce a threshold behavior
between exposed bedrock and regolith cover such that thin regolith
may quickly removed during high erosion rates, exposing bedrock.
