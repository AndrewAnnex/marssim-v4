 WEATHERING_TERM_2 (FOR TWO TERM WEATHERING)

This is the default weathering rate for the second term at
zero regolith cover.  To have a humped weathering rate function
versus regolith thickness this term should be less than or equal
to the rock weathering rate (WE1x popup). 

See popups WE0x and WE5x for more details.
