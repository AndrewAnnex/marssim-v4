 WEATHERING_DECAY_2 (FOR TWO TERM WEATHERING)

This term determines how rapidly the second term weathering
decreases with increase in regolith thickness.  To produce a 
humped regolith production function this value should be larger than
the term 1 weather decay rate. 

See popups WE0x and WE5x for more details.
