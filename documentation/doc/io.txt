INPUT FILES:

INELEV.DAT - initial elevations for the simulation  It, and most other data files read or written by the program,
    is read by the following pseudocode:
    
read (indata,*) mx,my !the x and y dimensions of the simulation domain
do i=1,mx
do j=1,my
   read(indata,*) elevation(i,j) !elevation is the surface elevation at location i,j
enddo
enddo

1: MARSSIM_INITIAL_BOUNDARY_CONDITIONS.PRM - the master parameters for the simulations.  

Parameters for specific processes are read from the following files.  
    Each of these files must be present in the execution directory.
    Additional files may be needed depending upon the processes being
    simulated.
2: BEDROCK_CHANNEL_PARAMETERS.PRM
3: ALLUVIAL_CHANNEL_PARAMETERS.PRM
4: FLOW_PARAMETERS.PRM
5: WEATHERING_PARAMETERS.PRM
6: ACCRETION_ABLATION_PARAMETERS.PRM
7: CRATERING_PARAMETERS.PRM
8: EOLIAN_PARAMETERS.PRM
9: GRAVEL_MIXTURE.RM
10: GROUNDWATER_PARAMETERS.PRM
11: LAVA_FLOW_PARAMETERS.PRM
12: MASS_FLOW.PRM
13: MASS_WASTING.PRM
14: REAL_CRATERS.PRM
ERODE.STOP  -This file is read every 10 iterations, reading a single integer.  
    If it is 1 the program stops and writes out files, otherwise if 0 the program continues.  
    To stop the program in mid-simulation without discarding results, copy ERODE.STOP.YES to ERODE.STOP.  
    But be sure to copy ERODE.STOP.NO to ERODE.STOP before the next simulation.

For some simulations, depending on switches set in parameter file 1: the following may be needed:

RESIST.IN   -a 3-D matrix of rock resistance
INREG.DAT   -initial conditions for regolith thickness
INRATES.DAT -reads time-varying simulation parameters 
INRIVER.PRM -allows specification of rivers entering the domain from outside
EVENTS.PRM  - specifies the time of specified programmed “events’
CRATER_EVENTS_PRM – Locations and sized of simulated craters.  Additional files are needed if 
    fresh martian craters are used to represent new craters.
SPATIAL_VARIATION.DAT - Matrix of spatially-varying values used to scale local runoff rates
    and/or local weathering rates, if selected.

OUTPUT FILES: (most output are written in subroutines in read_and_write_data_files.90 – 
    see the program routines for formatting and further explanation – 
    most of these consist of several concatenated records of data output 
    at intervals during the simulation in the same general format as INELEV.DAT.
    Relatively important output files are indicated in bold italics.  
    Some files will not be created unless the appropriate processes are included in the simulation, 
    and some will be created but not written to.

BASIN.LST   -a text file that summarizes the simulation parameters plus a good bit of data 
    on the progress of the simulations and a variety of rate-process information
OUTELEV.DAT -a text file of the surface elevations written at various times during the simulation.  
    This file usually includes several sequential datasets.  
ALLUVIAL.DAT    -an ascii file of 0’s to indicate locations that are bedrock channels, and 1’s for alluvial channels
DISCHARGE????.RAW   - raw image files of the logarithm of discharges within the drainage network.  
    Normalized so that low discharges are black, highest is white. 
    The dimensions of these images equals that of the elevation matrix.
BEDROCK.DAT -an ascii file of 0’s for regolith-covered locations, and 1’s for bare bedrock.
SUBMERGE????.RAW    - raw image files indicating submerged (black) and unsubmerged (white) locations. 
    The dimensions of these images equals that of the elevation matrix.
SUBMERGED.DAT-an ascii file of 1’s for underwater locations, otherwise 0’s for subaerial locations.
EROSION_DEPTH_INDEX.DAT -if variable rock resistance is used, this is the z-index of the surface in the 3-D rock resistance file.
OUTBASE.DAT - the elevation of the bottom of alluvial deposits, or, where they are absent, the land surface elevation.
REGOLITH.DAT    -the regolith thickness.
DEFORM.DAT  -if the rocks are actively deformed, writes the total amount of deformation during the simulation.
RESIST.OUT  -writes the erosional resistance for rocks at the surface (for variable rock resistance is a slice through RESIST.IN
    corresponding to the surface elevation).
REPORT.PRN  -a record of relief and erosion rate.
RECORD.DAT  -a record of several variables expressing the progression towards a steady-state landscape.
SUMMARY.DAT - some of the data printed out in basin.lst, but in bare-bones format.
STATISTICS.PRN – writes a sampling of the simulation state for emergent points at intervals during the simulation.
CHANNEL.DAT -information on stream channels.
CRATER.DAT  -information about individual simulated impact craters.
RELELE???.RAW   -files consisting of raw b&w images of surface elevation- scaled so that the lowest elevation
    is black and the highest is white. The dimensions of these images equals that of the elevation matrix.
TOPO.DAT    -a file that gives information on the elevation range corresponding to the images in RELELE????.RAW.
BSHADE????.PBM  -shaded relief images of the surface topography, output in sequential order during the 
    simulation and periodic intervals.  These filesc an be put together in Adobe Photoshop to make a movie. 
    If periodic boundary conditions are used these files can paste strips from the opposite side 
    in order to better portray the topography if selected. 
    If neither boundary is periodic the image size is (2*(MX-1), 2*(MY-1).  
    If the image is periodic in, say, the X dimension, then the horizontal image size increases to 2*(MX-1)+2*(MX/2+2) 
    and similarly if the image is periodic in the Y dimension.
BISTABLE.DAT – output file of locations that are (1) and are not (0) in the accelerated erosion state.
DEBUG.PRN  - A file of debugging data written by write_debug
SOURCE.DAT -  A file of stream source information written by stream_network_properties if it is utilized.
QQ.DAT  -if groundwater flow is simulated, is the matrix of groundwater discharges.
EWATER.DAT  -if groundwater flow is simulated, is the water table elevation.
ACTIVE.DAT  -if groundwater sapping is simulated, is locations that are presently undergoing sapping erosion.
LAVA.DAT    -if lava flows are simulated, whether lava has been deposited at that location.
LACTIVE.DAT -if lava flows are simulated, is the locations where lava flows are active.
LAGE.DAT    -if lava flows are simulated, is the age since the last lava was deposited at that location.
EOLIAN.DAT  -if eolian deposition is simulated, is the amount of eolian deposition or erosion.
BINGHAM_FLUX.DAT – if Bingham mass flow is modeled, gives the flux magnitude.
GLEN_FLUX.DAT – If Glen Law flow is selected gives the mass flux.
CUMULATIVE_...DAT  -net changes in state variable matrices during the simulation. 
    Exact name and number of files depends upon which processes are simulated.  
    See the subroutine write_net_change_matrices for details.
FINAL_...DAT – These are the final values of state variables.  
    Useful to analyze simulation results and to use to continue a simulation.  
    See the subroutine write_final_state for details.
BINARY_....DAT – if selected these are cumulative binary output files of surface elevation, stream discharges, 
    lake locations, and impact crater events.  
    This was specifically included to permit making movie files of landform evolution.  
    See the subroutine output_binary_data for details.
