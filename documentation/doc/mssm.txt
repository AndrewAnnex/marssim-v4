The program is coded in standard Fortran 90 in free-form format. 
It has been successfully compiled with a number of compilers, including Intel Fortran (Windows and Linux), 
PGI Fortran (linux), and the public-domain gfortran (Linux). 
The Intel Fortran and the Linux environments are recommended for fastest execution times. 
The program runs in a command-line environment (Command Prompt window in Windows, Terminal window in Linux).
A batch mode or background execution is recommended, e.g. nohup ./marssim & 
Compilation with optimization (e.g. -O4 or -fast) is recommended.  MARSSIM is NOT optimized for parallel execution.
For Intel fortran the fastest execution occurs with compilation: ifort -fast -heap-arrays ...
This will require installation of the static libraries: clib-static
For very large array sizes: ifort -ipo -O3 -fp-model fast=2 -xHost -mcmodel=medium -heap-arrays ...
